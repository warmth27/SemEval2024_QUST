"human_answers":["Animal cognition encompasses the mental capacities of non-human animals including insect cognition. 
The study of animal conditioning and learning used in this field was developed from comparative psychology. 
It has also been strongly influenced by research in ethology, behavioral ecology, and evolutionary psychology;  
the alternative name cognitive ethology is sometimes used. Many behaviors associated with the term animal intelligence are also subsumed within animal cognition.\nResearchers have examined animal cognition in mammals (especially primates, cetaceans, elephants, dogs, cats, pigs, horses, cattle, raccoons and rodents), birds (including parrots, fowl, corvids and pigeons), reptiles (lizards, snakes, and turtles), fish and invertebrates (including cephalopods, spiders and insects)."],"chatgpt_answers":["Animal cognition refers to the mental capacities of non-human animals. It includes the ability to process information, perceive and attend to stimuli, learn and remember, solve problems, and make decisions. These cognitive abilities are thought to be mediated by brain functions, and research on animal cognition seeks to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying these abilities.\n\n\n\nStudies of animal cognition have been conducted in a variety of species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. These studies have revealed that many animals are capable of sophisticated cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, learning, and decision-making. For example, some animals are able to use tools, communicate with others, and navigate complex environments.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding animal cognition can provide insight into the evolution of cognitive abilities in humans and other animals, and can also inform the development of animal-friendly practices in fields such as animal welfare, conservation, and animal-assisted therapy."]}

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Human intelligence\"","human_answers":["Human intelligence is the intellectual capability of humans, which is marked by complex cognitive feats and high levels of motivation and self-awareness. High intelligence is associated with better outcomes in life.\nThrough intelligence, humans possess the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, understand, apply logic and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, plan, innovate, solve problems, make decisions, retain information, and use language to communicate. There are conflicting ideas about how intelligence is measured, ranging from the idea that intelligence is fixed upon birth, or that it is malleable and can change depending on an individual's mindset and efforts. Several subcategories of intelligence, such as emotional intelligence or social intelligence, are heavily debated as to whether they are traditional forms of intelligence. They are generally thought to be distinct processes that occur, though there is speculation that they tie into traditional intelligence more than previously suspected."],"chatgpt_answers":["Human intelligence is the mental ability to think, learn, and understand concepts.

A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation's 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go and over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia.\nThe playing pieces are called stones. One player uses the white stones and the other, black. The players take turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections (points) of a board. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if the stone (or group of stones) is surrounded by opposing stones on all orthogonally adjacent points, in which case the stone or group is captured. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move. When a game concludes, the winner is determined by counting each player's surrounded territory along with captured stones and komi (points added to the score of the player with the white stones as compensation for playing second). Games may also be terminated by resignation.\nThe standard Go board has a 19\u00d719 grid of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play on smaller 9\u00d79 and 13\u00d713 boards, and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier centuries on a board with a 17\u00d717 grid.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"AI winter\"","human_answers":["In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The term was coined by analogy to the idea of a nuclear winter. The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or even decades later.\nThe term first appeared in 1984 as the topic of a public debate at the annual meeting of AAAI (then called the \"American Association of Artificial Intelligence\"). It is a chain reaction that begins with pessimism in the AI community, followed by pessimism in the press, followed by a severe cutback in funding, followed by the end of serious research. At the meeting, Roger Schank and Marvin Minsky\u2014two leading AI researchers who had survived the \"winter\" of the 1970s\u2014warned the business community that enthusiasm for AI had spiraled out of control in the 1980s and that disappointment would certainly follow. Three years later, the billion-dollar AI industry began to collapse.\nHype is common in many emerging technologies, such as the railway mania or the dot-com bubble. The AI winter was a result of such hype, due to over-inflated promises by developers, unnaturally high expectations from end-users, and extensive promotion in the media. Despite the rise and fall of AI's reputation, it has continued to develop new and successful technologies. AI researcher Rodney Brooks would complain in 2002 that \"there's this stupid myth out there that AI has failed, but AI is around you every second of the day.\" In 2005, Ray Kurzweil agreed: \"Many observers still think that the AI winter was the end of the story and that nothing since has come of the AI field. Yet today many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry.\"\nEnthusiasm and optimism about AI has generally increased since its low point in the early 1990s. Beginning about 2012, interest in artificial intelligence (and especially the sub-field of machine learning) from the research and corporate communities led to a dramatic increase in funding and investment.\nQuantum winter is the prospect of a similar development in quantum computing, anticipated or contemplated by Mikhail Dyakonov, Chris Hoofnagle, Simson Garfinkel, Victor Galitsky, and Nikita Gourianov."],"chatgpt_answers":["An \"AI winter\" refers to a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence (AI) research and development.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Symbolic AI\"","human_answers":["In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. \nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel's Checker's Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969\u20131986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988\u20132011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant's PAC learning, Quinlan's ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]\nNeural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt's perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: \"Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn't work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.\"[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]"],"chatgpt_answers":["Symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and logic-based methods to solve problems.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Formal reasoning\"","human_answers":["Reason is the capacity of consciously applying logic by drawing conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking the truth. It is closely[how?] associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality.\nReasoning is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one's intellect. The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as: deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning. Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition\u2014however valid\u2014may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.\nReasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.\nIn contrast to the use of \"reason\" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior.

The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and formal languages, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\".\nIn order to perform a rigorous study of computation, computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers called a model of computation. There are several models in use, but the most commonly examined is the Turing machine. Computer scientists study the Turing machine because it is simple to formulate, can be analyzed and used to prove results, and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible \"reasonable\" model of computation (see Church\u2013Turing thesis). It might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute, but any decidable problem solved by a Turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Church\u2013Turing thesis\"","human_answers":["In computability theory, the Church\u2013Turing thesis (also known as computability thesis, the  Turing\u2013Church thesis, the Church\u2013Turing conjecture, Church's thesis, Church's conjecture, and Turing's thesis) is a thesis about the nature of computable functions. It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine. The thesis is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church and the British mathematician Alan Turing. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability:\nChurch, Kleene, and Turing[11] proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is \u03bb-computable if and only if it is Turing computable, and if and only if it is general recursive. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see below).\nOn the other hand, the Church\u2013Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the informal notion of an effectively calculable function. Although the thesis has near-universal acceptance, it cannot be formally proven, as the concept of effective calculability is only informally defined.\nSince its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe (physical Church-Turing thesis) and what can be efficiently computed (Church\u2013Turing thesis (complexity theory)). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in complexity theory and digital physics. The thesis also has implications for the philosophy of mind (see below)."],"chatgpt_answers":["The Church-Turing thesis is a fundamental principle in computer science, mathematics, and philosophy.

Church was a logician and mathematician who developed the concept of the \"effective calculability\" of functions, which formed the basis for the Church-Turing thesis.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Information theory\"","human_answers":["Information theory is the scientific study of the quantification, storage, and communication of information. The field was originally established by the works of Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley, in the 1920s, and Claude Shannon in the 1940s.:\u200avii\u200a The field is at the intersection of probability theory, statistics, computer science, statistical mechanics, information engineering, and electrical engineering.\nA key measure in information theory is entropy. Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process. For example, identifying the outcome of a fair coin flip (with two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a die (with six equally likely outcomes). Some other important measures in information theory are mutual information, channel capacity, error exponents, and relative entropy. Important sub-fields of information theory include source coding, algorithmic complexity theory, algorithmic information theory and information-theoretic security.\nApplications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding\/data compression (e.g. for ZIP files), and channel coding\/error detection and correction (e.g. for DSL). Its impact has been crucial to the success of the Voyager missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones and the development of the Internet.

For example, if you know that a coin is fair, then the outcome of a coin flip is equally likely to be heads or tails, and the amount of information you receive from the outcome of the coin flip is low. On the other hand, if you don't know whether the coin is fair or not, then the outcome of the coin flip is more uncertain, and the amount of information you receive from the outcome is higher.\n\n\n\nIn information theory, the concept of entropy is used to quantify the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Pattern recognition\"","human_answers":["Pattern recognition is the automated recognition of patterns and regularities in data. It has applications in statistical data analysis, signal processing, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning. Pattern recognition has its origins in statistics and engineering; some modern approaches to pattern recognition include the use of machine learning, due to the increased availability of big data and a new abundance of processing power. These activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field of application, and they have undergone substantial development over the past few decades.\nPattern recognition systems are commonly trained from labeled \"training\" data. When no labeled data are available, other algorithms can be used to discover previously unknown patterns. KDD and data mining have a larger focus on unsupervised methods and stronger connection to business use. Pattern recognition focuses more on the signal and also takes acquisition and signal processing into consideration. It originated in engineering, and the term is popular in the context of computer vision: a leading computer vision conference is named Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.\nIn machine learning, pattern recognition is the assignment of a label to a given input value. In statistics, discriminant analysis was introduced for this same purpose in 1936. An example of pattern recognition is classification, which attempts to assign each input value to one of a given set of classes (for example, determine whether a given email is \"spam\"). Pattern recognition is a more general problem that encompasses other types of output as well. Other examples are regression, which assigns a real-valued output to each input; sequence labeling, which assigns a class to each member of a sequence of values (for example, part of speech tagging, which assigns a part of speech to each word in an input sentence); and parsing, which assigns a parse tree to an input sentence, describing the syntactic structure of the sentence.\nPattern recognition algorithms generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible inputs and to perform \"most likely\" matching of the inputs, taking into account their statistical variation. This is opposed to pattern matching algorithms, which look for exact matches in the input with pre-existing patterns. A common example of a pattern-matching algorithm is regular expression matching, which looks for patterns of a given sort in textual data and is included in the search capabilities of many text editors and word processors."],"chatgpt_answers":["Pattern recognition is the process of identifying patterns and regularities in data.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Domain ontology\"","human_answers":["In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, formal naming, and definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts, data, and entities that substantiate one, many, or all domains of discourse. More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.\nEvery academic discipline or field creates ontologies to limit complexity and organize data into information and knowledge. \nEach uses ontological assumptions to frame explicit theories, research and applications. New ontologies may improve problem solving within that domain. Translating research papers within every field is a problem made easier when experts from different countries maintain a controlled vocabulary of jargon between each of their languages.\nFor instance, the definition and ontology of economics is a primary concern in Marxist economics, but also in other subfields of economics. An example of economics relying on information science occurs in cases where a simulation or model is intended to enable economic decisions, such as determining what capital assets are at risk and by how much (see risk management).\nWhat ontologies in both computer science and philosophy have in common is the attempt to represent entities, ideas and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of ontology engineering (e.g., Quine and Kripke in philosophy, Sowa and Guarino in computer science), and debates concerning to what extent normative ontology is possible (e.g., foundationalism and coherentism in philosophy, BFO and Cyc in artificial intelligence).\nApplied ontology is considered a successor to prior work in philosophy, however many current efforts are more concerned with establishing controlled vocabularies of narrow domains than first principles, the existence of fixed essences or whether enduring objects (e.g., perdurantism and endurantism) may be ontologically more primary than processes.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Web Ontology Language\"","human_answers":["The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies. Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.\nOntologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences. Class hierarchies are meant to represent structures used in source code that evolve fairly slowly (perhaps with monthly revisions) whereas ontologies are meant to represent information on the Internet and are expected to be evolving almost constantly. Similarly, ontologies are typically far more flexible as they are meant to represent information on the Internet coming from all sorts of heterogeneous data sources. Class hierarchies on the other hand tend to be fairly static and rely on far less diverse and more structured sources of data such as corporate databases.\nThe OWL languages are characterized by formal semantics. They are built upon the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) standard for objects called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). OWL and RDF have attracted significant academic, medical and commercial interest.\nIn October 2007, a new W3C working group was started to extend OWL with several new features as proposed in the OWL 1.1 member submission. W3C announced the new version of OWL on 27 October 2009.

The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the true data and that line (or hyperplane). For specific mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given set of values.

Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset.

With the assistance of these techniques, MT has proven useful as a tool to assist human translators and, in a very limited number of cases, can even produce output that can be used as is (e.g., weather reports).\nThe progress and potential of machine translation have been much debated through its history.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Deep structure\"","human_answers":["Deep structure and surface structure (also D-structure and S-structure although those abbreviated forms are sometimes used with distinct meanings) are concepts used in linguistics, specifically in the study of syntax in the Chomskyan tradition of transformational generative grammar.\nThe deep structure of a linguistic expression is a theoretical construct that seeks to unify several related structures.  For example, the sentences \"Pat loves Chris\" and \"Chris is loved by Pat\" mean roughly the same thing and use similar words.  Some linguists, Chomsky in particular, have tried to account for this similarity by positing that these two sentences are distinct surface forms that derive from a common (or very similar) deep structure."],"chatgpt_answers":["In linguistics, the term \"deep structure\" refers to the underlying meaning and structure of a sentence or phrase, which is thought to be the source of the surface structure or the way that the sentence is actually expressed. This concept was developed by Noam Chomsky and his followers as part of their theory of transformational grammar, which proposes that the deep structure of a sentence is transformed into its surface structure through a series of rules.\n\n\n\nAccording to this theory, the deep structure of a sentence consists of the underlying syntactic and semantic relationships between the words and phrases in the sentence. It is thought to be the source of the various surface structures that a sentence can have, depending on the context in which it is used and the rules that are applied to transform it.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider the following sentence: \"The cat sat on the mat.\" This sentence has a simple deep structure that consists of a subject (\"the cat\"), a verb (\"sat\"), and an object (\"the mat\"). The surface structure of this sentence is the specific way that it is expressed, with the words arranged in a particular order and with specific inflections applied to the verb.\n\n\n\nDeep structure is an important concept in linguistics because it helps to explain how the meaning of a sentence is conveyed and how different surface structures can be derived from a single deep structure. It is also a key component of many theories of language and how it is processed in the brain."]}
{"question":"Please explain what is \"Intractability (complexity)\"","human_answers":["In theoretical computer science and mathematics, computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their resource usage, and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.\nA problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity, i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The P versus NP problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, is dedicated to the field of computational complexity.\nClosely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kinds of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically."],"chatgpt_answers":["Intractability, also known as complexity, refers to the difficulty of solving a problem or completing a task using a computer algorithm. Some problems are easy to solve and can be completed quickly by a computer, while others are much more difficult and may take a long time or even be impossible to solve using current technology.\n\n\n\nIntractability can be a result of the size of the problem, the number of steps required to solve the problem, or the amount of resources (such as time or memory) needed to solve the problem. It can also be caused by the inherent complexity of the problem itself, such as when the problem requires a large amount of computation or when the problem is not well-defined.\n\n\n\nSome examples of intractable problems include the traveling salesman problem, the shortest path problem, and the knapsack problem. These problems are difficult to solve because they require a large amount of computation or because there are a large number of possible solutions that must be considered.\n\n\n\nIntractability is an important concept in computer science and can have significant implications for the design and implementation of algorithms and computer systems. Understanding the complexity of a problem can help researchers and engineers determine the feasibility of solving the problem using current technology and can inform the development of new algorithms and approaches for solving difficult problems."]}

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Speech recognition\"","human_answers":["Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers with the main benefit of searchability. It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT). It incorporates knowledge and research in the computer science, linguistics and computer engineering fields. The reverse process is speech synthesis.\nSome speech recognition systems require \"training\" (also called \"enrollment\") where an individual speaker reads text or isolated vocabulary into the system. The system analyzes the person's specific voice and uses it to fine-tune the recognition of that person's speech, resulting in increased accuracy. Systems that do not use training are called \"speaker-independent\" systems. Systems that use training are called \"speaker dependent\".\nSpeech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice dialing (e.g. \"call home\"), call routing (e.g. \"I would like to make a collect call\"), domotic appliance control, search key words (e.g. find a podcast where particular words were spoken), simple data entry (e.g., entering a credit card number), preparation of structured documents (e.g. a radiology report), determining speaker characteristics, speech-to-text processing (e.g., word processors or emails), and aircraft (usually termed direct voice input).\nThe term voice recognition or speaker identification refers to identifying the speaker, rather than what they are saying. Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.\nFrom the technology perspective, speech recognition has a long history with several waves of major innovations.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Logical consequence\"","human_answers":["Logical consequence (also entailment) is a fundamental concept in logic, which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises. The philosophical analysis of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises?  and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?  All of philosophical logic is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of logical truth.\nLogical consequence is necessary and formal, by way of examples that explain with formal proof and models of interpretation. A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given language, if and only if, using only logic (i.e., without regard to any personal interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true.\nLogicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given language \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n, either by constructing a deductive system for \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n or by formal intended semantics for language \n\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n\n.  The Polish logician Alfred Tarski identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment: (1) The logical consequence relation relies on the logical form of the sentences: (2) The relation is a priori, i.e., it can be determined with or without regard to empirical evidence (sense experience); and (3) The logical consequence relation has a modal component."],"chatgpt_answers":["In logic, a logical consequence is a statement that follows logically from one or more statements.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Inference rule\"","human_answers":["In the philosophy of logic, a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions). For example, the rule of inference called modus ponens takes two premises, one in the form \"If p then q\" and another in the form \"p\", and returns the conclusion \"q\". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion.\nTypically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In many-valued logic, it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference's action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are recursive are important; i.e. rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule. An example of a rule that is not effective in this sense is the infinitary \u03c9-rule.\nPopular rules of inference in propositional logic include modus ponens, modus tollens, and contraposition.

Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem.

For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to exact algorithms such as gradient descent or branch and bound.\nThe name of the algorithm comes from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its physical properties. Both are attributes of the material that depend on their thermodynamic free energy. Heating and cooling the material affects both the temperature and the thermodynamic free energy or Gibbs energy.\nSimulated annealing can be used for very hard computational optimization problems where exact algorithms fail; even though it usually achieves an approximate solution to the global minimum, it could be enough for many practical problems.\nThe problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an objective function of many variables, subject to several constraints. In practice, the constraint can be penalized as part of the objective function.\nSimilar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970), Khachaturyan et al (1979, 1981), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985). In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., Vecchi, for a solution of the traveling salesman problem.

Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, simulated annealing algorithms work as follows. The temperature progressively decreases from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions, which during the search respectively remain at 1 (or positive) and decrease toward zero.\nThe simulation can be performed either by a solution of kinetic equations for density functions or by using the stochastic sampling method.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Artificial selection\"","human_answers":["Selective breeding (also called artificial selection) is the process by which humans use animal breeding and plant breeding to selectively develop particular phenotypic traits (characteristics) by choosing which typically animal or plant males and females will sexually reproduce and have offspring together. Domesticated animals are known as breeds, normally bred by a professional breeder, while domesticated plants are known as varieties, cultigens, cultivars, or breeds. Two purebred animals of different breeds produce a crossbreed, and crossbred plants are called hybrids. Flowers, vegetables and fruit-trees may be bred by amateurs and commercial or non-commercial professionals: major crops are usually the provenance of the professionals.\nIn animal breeding, techniques such as inbreeding, linebreeding, and outcrossing are utilized. In plant breeding, similar methods are used. Charles Darwin discussed how selective breeding had been successful in producing change over time in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species. Its first chapter discusses selective breeding and domestication of such animals as pigeons, cats, cattle, and dogs. Darwin used artificial selection as a springboard to introduce and support the theory of natural selection.\nThe deliberate exploitation of selective breeding to produce desired results has become very common in agriculture and experimental biology.\nSelective breeding can be unintentional, for example, resulting from the process of human cultivation; and it may also produce unintended \u2013 desirable or undesirable \u2013 results. For example, in some grains, an increase in seed size may have resulted from certain ploughing practices rather than from the intentional selection of larger seeds. Most likely, there has been an interdependence between natural and artificial factors that have resulted in plant domestication."],"chatgpt_answers":["Artificial selection is a process by which humans breed plants and animals for specific traits or characteristics. It is a form of selective breeding in which humans deliberately choose which individuals will reproduce, based on their desired traits. This is in contrast to natural selection, which is the process by which traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction are passed on to future generations through the process of evolution.\n\n\n\nArtificial selection has been used for thousands of years to breed domesticated animals and plants for various purposes, such as increasing their size, improving their flavor, or enhancing their appearance. For example, humans have bred cattle for meat, milk, and leather; dogs for hunting, herding, and guarding; and crops for yield, taste, and disease resistance.\n\n\n\nArtificial selection can also be used in the laboratory setting to create genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In this process, scientists can use techniques such as gene editing to introduce specific traits into an organism's genome, or they can transfer genes from one organism to another using techniques such as genetic engineering.\n\n\n\nOverall, artificial selection is a powerful tool that has had a significant impact on the diversity of plants and animals that we see today, and it continues to be an important area of research and development in the field of biology."]}

Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing.\nAs an example, ant colony optimization  is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony.  Artificial 'ants' (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions.  Real ants lay down pheromones directing each other to resources while exploring their environment.

They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.\nAnts form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called \"drones\" and one or more fertile females called \"queens\" (gynes). The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.\nAnts have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. The only places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in moist tropical ecosystems and may exceed the combined biomass of wild birds and mammals.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Quantifier (logic)\"","human_answers":["In logic, a quantifier is an operator that specifies how many individuals in the domain of discourse satisfy an open formula.

As an example, the only difference in the definition of uniform continuity and (ordinary) continuity is the order of quantifications.\nFirst order quantifiers approximate the meanings of some natural language quantifiers such as \"some\" and \"all\".

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Circumscription (logic)\"","human_answers":["Circumscription is a non-monotonic logic created by John McCarthy to formalize the common sense assumption that things are as expected unless otherwise specified. Circumscription was later used by McCarthy in an attempt to solve the frame problem. To implement circumscription in its initial formulation, McCarthy augmented first-order logic  to allow the minimization of the extension of some predicates, where the extension of a predicate is the set of tuples of values the predicate is true on. This minimization is similar to the closed-world assumption that what is not known to be true is false.\nThe original problem considered by McCarthy was that of missionaries and cannibals: there are three missionaries and three cannibals on one bank of a river; they have to cross the river using a boat that can only take two, with the additional constraint that cannibals must never outnumber the missionaries on either bank (as otherwise the missionaries would be killed and, presumably, eaten). The problem considered by McCarthy was not that of finding a sequence of steps to reach the goal (the article on the missionaries and cannibals problem contains one such solution), but rather that of excluding conditions that are not explicitly stated. For example, the solution \"go half a mile south and cross the river on the bridge\" is intuitively not valid because the statement of the problem does not mention such a bridge. On the other hand, the existence of this bridge is not excluded by the statement of the problem either. That the bridge does not exist is\na consequence of the implicit assumption that the statement of the problem contains everything that is relevant to its solution. Explicitly stating that a bridge does not exist is not a solution to this problem, as there are many other exceptional conditions that should be excluded (such as the presence of a rope for fastening the cannibals, the presence of a larger boat nearby, etc.)\nCircumscription was later used by McCarthy to formalize the implicit assumption of inertia: things do not change unless otherwise specified.  Circumscription seemed to be useful to avoid specifying that conditions are not changed by all actions except those explicitly known to change them; this is known as the frame problem. However, the solution proposed by McCarthy was later shown leading to wrong results in some cases, like in the Yale shooting problem scenario.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Kalman filter\"","human_answers":["For statistics and control theory, Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, including statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n, who was one of the primary developers of its theory.\nThis digital filter is sometimes termed the Stratonovich\u2013Kalman\u2013Bucy filter because it is a special case of a more general, nonlinear filter developed somewhat earlier by the Soviet mathematician Ruslan Stratonovich. In fact, some of the special case linear filter's equations appeared in  papers by Stratonovich that were published before summer 1960, when Kalman met with Stratonovich during a conference in Moscow.\nKalman filtering has numerous technological applications. A common application is for guidance, navigation, and control of vehicles, particularly aircraft, spacecraft and ships positioned dynamically. Furthermore, Kalman filtering is a concept much applied in time series analysis used for topics such as signal processing and econometrics. Kalman filtering is also one of the main topics of robotic motion planning and control and can be used for trajectory optimization.[10] Kalman filtering also works for modeling the central nervous system's control of movement. Due to the time delay between issuing motor commands and receiving sensory feedback, the use of Kalman filters[11] provides a realistic model for making estimates of the current state of a motor system and issuing updated commands.[12]\nThe algorithm works by a two-phase process. For the prediction phase, the Kalman filter produces estimates of the current state variables, along with their uncertainties. Once the outcome of the next measurement (necessarily corrupted with some error, including random noise) is observed, these estimates are updated using a weighted average, with more weight being given to estimates with greater certainty. The algorithm is recursive. It can operate in real time, using only the present input measurements and the state calculated previously and its uncertainty matrix; no additional past information is required.\nOptimality of Kalman filtering assumes that errors have a normal (Gaussian) distribution.  In the words of Rudolf E. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n: \"In summary, the following assumptions are made about random processes: Physical random phenomena may be thought of as due to primary random sources exciting dynamic systems. The primary sources are assumed to be independent gaussian random processes with zero mean; the dynamic systems will be linear.\"[13]  Though regardless of Gaussianity, if the process and measurement covariances are known, the Kalman filter is the best possible linear estimator in the minimum mean-square-error sense.[14]\nExtensions and generalizations of the method have also been developed, such as the extended Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter which work on nonlinear systems. The basis is a hidden Markov model such that the state space of the latent variables is continuous and all latent and observed variables have Gaussian distributions. Kalman filtering has been used successfully in multi-sensor fusion,[15] and distributed sensor networks to develop distributed or consensus Kalman filtering.[16]"],"chatgpt_answers":["The Kalman filter is a mathematical method used to estimate the state of a system from noisy and incomplete observations.

It works by combining an initial estimate of the state of the system with additional information from noisy observations to produce a more accurate estimate.\n\n\n\nThe Kalman filter involves two steps: prediction and correction. In the prediction step, the filter uses a process model to predict the state of the system at the next time step based on the current estimate and any additional control inputs. In the correction step, the filter updates the estimate based on new observations, using a measurement model to relate the observations to the state of the system.\n\n\n\nThe Kalman filter can be used for both linear and nonlinear systems, and it is often used in applications where the system being modeled is uncertain or the observations are noisy.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Hebbian learning\"","human_answers":["Hebbian theory is a neuroscientific theory claiming that an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from a presynaptic cell's repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell. It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process. It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior. The theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows:\nThe theory is often summarized as \"Cells that fire together wire together.\" However, Hebb emphasized that cell A needs to \"take part in firing\" cell B, and such causality can occur only if cell A fires just before, not at the same time as, cell B. This aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is now known about spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which requires temporal precedence.\nThe theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning, in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells.

Conversely, stepping in the direction of the gradient will lead to a local maximum of that function; the procedure is then known as gradient ascent.\nGradient descent is generally attributed to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847.

Receptive fields can positively or negatively alter the membrane potential with or without affecting the rate of action potentials.\nA sensory space can be dependent of an animal's location. For a particular sound wave traveling in an appropriate transmission medium, by means of sound localization, an auditory space would amount to a reference system that continuously shifts as the animal moves (taking into consideration the space inside the ears as well). Conversely, receptive fields can be largely independent of the animal's location, as in the case of place cells. A sensory space can also map into a particular region on an animal's body.

It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\nApple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by  Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\nAs the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as \"Wintel\"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching \"Think different\" and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Face ID\"","human_answers":["Face ID is a facial recognition system designed and developed by Apple Inc. for the iPhone and iPad Pro. The system allows biometric authentication for unlocking a device, making payments, accessing sensitive data, providing detailed facial expression tracking for Animoji, as well as six degrees of freedom (6DOF) head-tracking, eye-tracking, and other features. Initially released in November 2017 with the iPhone X, it has since been updated and introduced to several new iPhone models, and all iPad Pro models.\nThe Face ID hardware consists of a sensor with three modules; a dot projector that projects a grid of small infrared dots onto a user's face, a module called the flood illuminator that shines infrared light at the face, and an infrared camera which takes an infrared picture of the user, reads the resulting pattern and generates a 3D facial map. This map is compared with the registered face using a secure subsystem, and the user is authenticated if the two faces match sufficiently. The system can recognize faces with glasses, clothing, makeup, and facial hair, and adapts to changes in appearance over time.\nFace ID has sparked a number of debates about security and privacy. Apple claims that Face ID is statistically more advanced than Touch ID fingerprint scanning. It exhibits significantly fewer false positives. Still, Face ID has shown issues at separating identical twins. Multiple security features largely limit the risk of the system being bypassed using photos or masks, and only one proof-of-concept attempt using detailed scans has succeeded. Debate continues over the lack of legal protections offered by biometric systems as compared to passcode authentication in the United States. Privacy advocates have also expressed concern about third-party app developers' access to \"rough maps\" of user facial data, despite rigid requirements by Apple of how developers handle facial data.\nOn some devices, Face ID is unable to recognize users wearing face masks. Apple responded to criticism by offering faster fallback to passcode input, and the option for Apple Watch users to confirm whether they intended to unlock their iPhone.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Computer Go\"","human_answers":["Computer Go is the field of artificial intelligence (AI) dedicated to creating a computer program that plays the traditional board game Go.  The field is sharply divided into two eras.  Before 2015, the programs of the era were weak.  The best efforts of the 1980s and 1990s produced only AIs that could be defeated by beginners, and AIs of the early 2000s were intermediate level at best.  Professionals could defeat these programs even given handicaps of 10+ stones in favor of the AI.  Many of the algorithms such as alpha-beta minimax that performed well as AIs for checkers and chess fell apart on Go's 19x19 board, as there were too many branching possibilities to consider.  Creation of a human professional quality program with the techniques and hardware of the time was out of reach.  Some AI researchers speculated that the problem was unsolvable without creation of human-like AI.\nThe application of Monte Carlo tree search to Go algorithms provided a notable improvement in the late 2000s decade, with programs finally able to achieve a low-dan level: that of an advanced amateur.  High-dan amateurs and professionals could still exploit these programs' weaknesses and win consistently, but computer performance had advanced past the intermediate (single-digit kyu) level.  The tantalizing unmet goal of defeating the best human players without a handicap, long thought unreachable, brought a burst of renewed interest.  The key insight proved to be an application of machine learning and deep learning.  DeepMind, a Google acquisition dedicated to AI research, produced AlphaGo in 2015 and announced it to the world in 2016.  AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, a 9 dan professional, in a no-handicap match in 2016, then defeated Ke Jie in 2017, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Go handicaps\"","human_answers":["Within most systems and at most levels in the game of Go, a handicap is given to offset the strength difference between players of different ranks."],"chatgpt_answers":["In the game of Go, handicaps are used to level the playing field between players of different skill levels. Handicaps are given to the weaker player in the form of extra stones placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The number of handicap stones is determined by the difference in rank between the two players.\n\n\n\nFor example, if one player is two ranks higher than the other, the weaker player may be given a two-stone handicap. This means that the weaker player will place two stones on the board at predetermined positions before the stronger player makes the first move. The stronger player then plays as usual, but must consider the additional stones placed on the board as part of the weaker player's strategy.\n\n\n\nHandicaps are used in Go to make the game more competitive and enjoyable for both players, as it allows players of different skill levels to play against each other without one player having a significant advantage."]}

The VCS was bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge\u2014initially Combat and later Pac-Man.\nAtari was successful at creating arcade video games, but their development cost and limited lifespan drove CEO Nolan Bushnell to seek a programmable home system. The first inexpensive microprocessors from MOS Technology in late 1975 made this feasible. The console was prototyped as codename Stella by Atari subsidiary Cyan Engineering. Lacking funding to complete the project, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in 1976.\nThe Atari VCS launched in 1977 with nine simple, low-resolution games in 2 KB cartridges. The system's first killer app was the home conversion of Taito's arcade game Space Invaders in 1980. The VCS became widely successful, leading to the founding of Activision and other third-party game developers and to competition from console manufacturers Mattel and Coleco. By the end of its primary lifecycle in 1983\u201384, games for the 2600 were using more than four times the storage size of the launch games with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for, such as Activision's Pitfall!.\nIn 1982, the Atari 2600 was the dominant game system in North America. Amid competition from both new consoles and game developers, a number of poor decisions from Atari management affected the company and the industry as a whole. The most public was an extreme investment into licensed games for the 2600, including Pac-Man and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Pac-Man became the system's biggest selling game, but the conversion's poor quality eroded consumer confidence in the console. E.T. was rushed to market for the holiday shopping season and was critically panned and a commercial failure. Both games, and a glut of third-party shovelware, were factors in ending Atari's relevance in the console market. Atari's downfall reverberated through the industry resulting in the video game crash of 1983.\nWarner sold Atari's home division to former Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel in 1984. In 1986, the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a lower-cost version of the 2600 and the backward-compatible Atari 7800, but it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry with its 1985 launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Turing test\"","human_answers":["The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation was a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel, such as a computer keyboard and screen, so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator could not reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine would be said to have passed the test. The test results would not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only on how closely its answers resembled those a human would give.\nThe test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" while working at the University of Manchester. It opens with the words: \"I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'\" Because \"thinking\" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to \"replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.\" Turing describes the new form of the problem in terms of a three-person game called the \"imitation game\", in which an interrogator asks questions of a man and a woman in another room in order to determine the correct sex of the two players. Turing's new question is: \"Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?\" This question, Turing believed, was one that could actually be answered.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Algorithmic bias\"","human_answers":["Algorithmic bias describes systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create \"unfair\" outcomes, such as \"privileging\" one category over another in ways different from the intended function of the algorithm.\nBias can emerge from many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. For example, algorithmic bias has been observed in search engine results and social media platforms. This bias can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect \"systematic and unfair\" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (2018) and the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act (2021).\nAs algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise (in part due to the psychological phenomenon of automation bias), and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software's initial design.\nAlgorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of online hate speech. It has also arisen in criminal justice, healthcare, and hiring, compounding existing racial, socioeconomic, and gender biases. The relative inability of facial recognition technology to accurately identify darker-skinned faces has been linked to multiple wrongful arrests of black men, an issue stemming from imbalanced datasets. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias persist due to the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. In many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single \"algorithm\" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service."],"chatgpt_answers":["Algorithmic bias refers to the systematic and unfair discrimination that occurs when algorithms and automated systems are used to make decisions that affect people. It can occur when an algorithm is trained on biased data or when the algorithm itself is designed in a biased way. Algorithmic bias can have serious consequences for individuals and society, as it can perpetuate and amplify existing biases and inequalities.\n\n\n\nFor example, if an algorithm is trained to predict who is likely to default on a loan, and the training data is biased because it disproportionately includes data on people from certain racial or socioeconomic groups who are more likely to default, the algorithm may be biased against those groups. This could result in people from those groups being unfairly denied loans or being offered less favorable terms. Similarly, if an algorithm is designed to screen job applicants and is biased against certain groups, it could result in those groups being unfairly excluded from job opportunities.\n\n\n\nIt is important to recognize and address algorithmic bias in order to promote fairness and avoid negative consequences for individuals and society.

He is a Laureate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona and an Institute Professor Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and is the author of more than 150 books on topics such as linguistics, war, politics, and mass media. Ideologically, he aligns with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism.\nBorn to Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania. During his postgraduate work in the Harvard Society of Fellows, Chomsky developed the theory of transformational grammar for which he earned his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, and in 1957 emerged as a significant figure in linguistics with his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which played a major role in remodeling the study of language. From 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He created or co-created the universal grammar theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of linguistic behaviorism, and was particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.\nAn outspoken opponent of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which he saw as an act of American imperialism, in 1967 Chomsky rose to national attention for his anti-war essay \"The Responsibility of Intellectuals\". Becoming associated with the New Left, he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President Richard Nixon's list of political opponents. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the linguistics wars. In collaboration with Edward S. Herman, Chomsky later articulated the propaganda model of media criticism in Manufacturing Consent, and worked to expose the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. His defense of unconditional freedom of speech, including that of Holocaust denial, generated significant controversy in the Faurisson affair of the 1980s. Since retiring from active teaching at MIT, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq and supporting the Occupy movement. Chomsky began teaching at the University of Arizona in 2017.\nOne of the most cited scholars alive,[d] Chomsky has influenced a broad array of academic fields.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Explainable AI\"","human_answers":["Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. It contrasts with the \"black box\" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.  XAI is relevant even if there is no legal right or regulatory requirement. For example, XAI can improve the user experience of a product or service by helping end users trust that the AI is making good decisions. This way the aim of XAI is to explain what has been done, what is done right now, what will be done next and unveil the information the actions are based on. These characteristics make it possible (i) to confirm existing knowledge (ii) to challenge existing knowledge and (iii) to generate new assumptions.\nThe algorithms used in AI can be differentiated into white-box and black-box machine learning (ML) algorithms. White-box models are ML models that provide results that are understandable for experts in the domain. Black-box models, on the other hand, are extremely hard to explain and can hardly be understood even by domain experts.[10] XAI algorithms are considered to follow the three principles of transparency, interpretability and explainability. Transparency is given \u201cif the processes that extract model parameters from training data and generate labels from testing data can be described and motivated by the approach designer\u201d.[11] Interpretability describes the possibility of comprehending the ML model and presenting the underlying basis for decision-making in a way that is understandable to humans.[12][13][14] Explainability is a concept that is recognized as important, but a joint definition is not yet available.[11] It is suggested that explainability in ML can be considered as \u201cthe collection of features of the interpretable domain, that have contributed for a given example to produce a decision (e.g., classification or regression)\u201d.[15] If algorithms meet these requirements, they provide a basis for justifying decisions, tracking and thereby verifying them, improving the algorithms, and exploring new facts.[16]\nSometimes it is also possible to achieve a result with high accuracy with a white-box ML algorithm that is interpretable in itself.[17] This is especially important in domains like medicine, defense, finance and law, where it is crucial to understand the decisions and build up trust in the algorithms. Many researchers argue that, at least for supervised machine learning, the way forward is symbolic regression, where the algorithm searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset.[18][19][20]\nAI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command \"maximize accuracy of assessing how positive film reviews are in the test dataset\". The AI may learn useful general rules from the test set, such as \"reviews containing the word 'horrible' are likely to be negative\". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as \"reviews containing 'Daniel Day-Lewis' are usually positive\"; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the train set, or if people consider the rule to be \"cheating\" or \"unfair\". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.[21]"],"chatgpt_answers":["Explainable AI, also known as XAI, refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can provide clear and understandable explanations for their decision-making processes and predictions.

The term qualia derives from the Latin neuter plural form (qualia) of the Latin adjective qu\u0101lis (Latin pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8k\u02b7a\u02d0l\u026as]) meaning \"of what sort\" or \"of what kind\" in a specific instance, such as \"what it is like to taste a specific apple\u200a\u2014\u200athis particular apple now\".\nExamples of qualia include the perceived sensation of pain of a headache, the taste of wine, as well as the redness of an evening sky. As qualitative characters of sensation, qualia stand in contrast to propositional attitudes, where the focus is on beliefs about experience rather than what it is directly like to be experiencing.\nPhilosopher and cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett once suggested that qualia was \"an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us: the ways things seem to us\".\nMuch of the debate over their importance hinges on the definition of the term, and various philosophers emphasize or deny the existence of certain features of qualia. Consequently, the nature and existence of qualia under various definitions remain controversial. While some philosophers of mind like Daniel Dennett argue that qualia do not exist and are incompatible with neuroscience and naturalism, some neuroscientists and neurologists like Gerald Edelman, Antonio Damasio, Vilayanur Ramachandran, Giulio Tononi, Christof Koch and Rodolfo Llin\u00e1s state that qualia exist and that the desire to eliminate them is based on an erroneous interpretation on the part of some philosophers regarding what constitutes science.[10][11][12][13][14][excessive citations]"],"chatgpt_answers":["Subjective experience refers to the personal, individual experience of the world and one's own thoughts, feelings, and sensations.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Mind-body problem\"","human_answers":["The mind\u2013body problem is a philosophical debate concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind, and the brain as part of the physical body. The debate goes beyond addressing the mere question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically. Interactionism arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.\nThe problem was popularized by Ren\u00e9 Descartes in the 17th century, resulting in Cartesian dualism, and by pre-Aristotelian philosophers, in Avicennian philosophy, and in earlier Asian traditions. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either dualist or monist. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains that there is only one unifying reality as in neutral or substance or essence, in terms of which everything can be explained.\nEach of these categories contains numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are substance dualism, which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and property dualism, which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are physicalism, which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; idealism, which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely a representation of mental processes; and neutral monism, which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. Psychophysical parallelism is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).\nSeveral philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind\u2013body dichotomy. The historical materialism of Karl Marx and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment. An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French structuralism, and is a position that generally characterized post-war Continental philosophy.\nThe absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind (if there is such a thing) and its physical extension (if there is such a thing) has been raised as a criticism of dualism, and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.[10] These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, particularly in the fields of sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology, and the neurosciences.[11][12][13][14]\nAn ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model, described in the Buddhist teachings, explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena.[15] Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences\/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual's mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.[15]"],"chatgpt_answers":["The mind-body problem is a philosophical question that asks how the mind and the body are related. It has been a central issue in philosophy for centuries, and it has implications for how we understand the nature of consciousness, the self, and the relationship between the mind and the physical world.\n\n\n\nOne way to approach the mind-body problem is to consider whether the mind is a distinct entity from the body, or whether it is simply a product of the body's physical processes. This is known as the dualist view. Dualists believe that the mind and the body are separate entities that interact with each other, but are not identical.\n\n\n\nAnother way to approach the mind-body problem is to consider the mind and the body as two different aspects of the same thing. This is known as monist view.

His writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, and he is recognized as having had \"an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960.\" Until his death in 2017 he held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University.\nFodor was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation.[citation needed] He argued that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are relations between individuals and mental representations. He maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adhered to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.\nFor Fodor, significant parts of the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or \"organs\", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent of each other and of the \"central processing\" part of the mind, which has a more global and less \"domain specific\" character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world. The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.:\u200a73\u201375\u200a\nAlthough Fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind. He argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theories of natural selection."],"chatgpt_answers":["Jerry Fodor was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist.

He made significant contributions to philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science. Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis\u2013Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem.\nPutnam was known for his willingness to apply equal scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws. As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his positions. In philosophy of mind, Putnam is known for his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind\u2013body problem.[10] In philosophy of language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a thought experiment called Twin Earth.[11]\nIn philosophy of mathematics, Putnam and W. V. O. Quine developed the Quine\u2013Putnam indispensability argument, an argument for the reality of mathematical entities,[12] later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but \"quasi-empirical\".[13] In epistemology, Putnam is known for his critique of the well-known \"brain in a vat\" thought experiment. This thought experiment appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism, but Putnam challenges its coherence.[14] In metaphysics, he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism, but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics, first adopting a view he called \"internal realism\",[15] which he later abandoned. Despite these changes of view, throughout his career Putnam remained committed to scientific realism, roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are.[16]\nIn his later work, Putnam became increasingly interested in American pragmatism, Jewish philosophy, and ethics, engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions. He also displayed an interest in metaphilosophy, seeking to \"renew philosophy\" from what he identified as narrow and inflated concerns.[17] He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[18]"],"chatgpt_answers":["Hilary Putnam was a philosopher and mathematician who made significant contributions to the fields of philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and philosophy of science.

Similar arguments were presented by Gottfried Leibniz (1714),  Anatoly Dneprov (1961), Lawrence Davis (1974) and Ned Block (1978). Searle's version has been widely discussed in the years since.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Animal rights\"","human_answers":["Animal rights is the philosophy according to which many or all sentient animals have moral worth that is independent of their utility for humans, and that their most basic interests\u2014such as avoiding suffering\u2014should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings. Broadly speaking, and particularly in popular discourse, the term \"animal rights\" is often used synonymously with \"animal protection\" or \"animal liberation\". More narrowly, \"animal rights\" refers to the idea that many animals have fundamental rights to be treated with respect as individuals\u2014rights to life, liberty, and freedom from torture that may not be overridden by considerations of aggregate welfare.\nMany advocates for animal rights oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone. This idea, known as speciesism, is considered by them to be a prejudice as irrational as any other. They maintain that animals should no longer be viewed as property or used as food, clothing, entertainment, or beasts of burden because their status as a different species from humans should not give them different rights from humans. Multiple cultural traditions around the world such as Jainism, Taoism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shinto and Animism also espouse some forms of animal rights.\nIn parallel to the debate about moral rights, law schools in North America now often teach animal law, and several legal scholars, such as Steven M. Wise and Gary L. Francione, support the extension of basic legal rights and personhood to non-human animals. The animals most often considered in arguments for personhood are hominids. Some animal-rights academics support this because it would break through the species barrier, but others oppose it because it predicates moral value on mental complexity, rather than on sentience alone. As of November\u00a02019[update], 29 countries had enacted bans on hominoid experimentation; Argentina has granted a captive orangutan basic human rights since 2014.\nOutside the order of primates, animal-rights discussions most often address the status of mammals (compare charismatic megafauna). Other animals (considered less sentient) have gained less attention; insects relatively little[10]\n(outside Jainism), and animal-like bacteria (despite their overwhelming numbers) hardly any.[11] The vast majority of animals have no legally recognised rights.[12]\nCritics of animal rights argue that nonhuman animals are unable to enter into a social contract, and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed up by the philosopher Roger Scruton (1944\u20132020), who writes that only humans have duties, and therefore only humans have rights.[13] Another argument, associated with the utilitarian tradition, maintains that animals may be used as resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering;[14] animals may have some moral standing, but they are inferior in status to human beings, and any interests they have may be overridden, though what counts as \"necessary\" suffering or a legitimate sacrifice of interests can vary considerably.[15] Certain forms of animal-rights activism, such as the destruction of fur farms and of animal laboratories by the Animal Liberation Front, have attracted criticism, including from within the animal-rights movement itself,[16] and have prompted reaction from the U.S. Congress with the enactment of laws, including the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, allowing the prosecution of this sort of activity as terrorism.[17]"],"chatgpt_answers":["Animal rights is a philosophical belief that animals, as sentient beings, have moral rights that should be considered and protected.

Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\", and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"The Economist\"","human_answers":["The Economist is a British weekly newspaper printed in demitab format and published digitally. It focuses on current affairs, international business, politics, technology, and culture. Based in London, the newspaper is owned by The Economist Group, with its core editorial offices in the United States, as well as across major cities in continental Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2019, its average global print circulation was over 909,476; this, combined with its digital presence, runs to over 1.6 million. Across its social media platforms, it reaches an audience of 35 million, as of 2016. The newspaper has a prominent focus on data journalism and interpretive analysis over original reporting, to both criticism and acclaim.\nFounded in 1843, The Economist was first circulated by Scottish economist James Wilson to muster support for abolishing the British Corn Laws (1815\u20131846), a system of import tariffs. Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into political economy and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid-to-late 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding opinion columns, special reports, political cartoons, reader letters, cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is often recognizable by its fire engine red nameplate and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with no byline, in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. It is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, 1843, and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.\nThe editorial stance of The Economist primarily revolves around classical, social, and most notably economic liberalism. It has supported radical centrism as the concept became established in the late 20th century, favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics. The newspaper typically champions economic liberalism, particularly free markets, free trade, free immigration, deregulation, and globalisation. Despite a pronounced editorial stance, it is seen as having little reporting bias, and as exercising rigorous fact-checking and strict copyediting.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Speaker recognition\"","human_answers":["Speaker recognition is the identification of a person from characteristics of voices. It is used to answer the question \"Who is speaking?\" The term voice recognition can refer to speaker recognition or speech recognition. Speaker verification (also called speaker authentication) contrasts with identification, and speaker recognition differs from speaker diarisation (recognizing when the same speaker is speaking).\nRecognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on specific voices or it can be used to authenticate or verify the identity of a speaker as part of a security process.

It is often used in security systems to verify the identity of a person before granting them access to a certain area or system.\n\n\n\nThere are two main types of speaker recognition: speaker identification and speaker verification. Speaker identification is used to determine the identity of a speaker from a group of known speakers. This can be useful in situations where there is a need to identify an unknown speaker, such as in a criminal investigation. Speaker verification, on the other hand, is used to verify the identity of a speaker by comparing their voice to a known sample. This is often used in security systems to ensure that only authorized individuals can gain access to certain areas or systems.\n\n\n\nSpeaker recognition systems work by analyzing the unique characteristics of a person's voice, such as pitch, frequency, and the shape of the vocal tract.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Training data\"","human_answers":["In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data. These input data used to build the model are usually divided in multiple data sets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model: training, validation and test sets.\nThe model is initially fit on a training data set, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model. The model (e.g. a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training data set using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training data set often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training data set and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training data set. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.\nSuccessively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second data set called the validation data set. The validation data set provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data set while tuning the model's hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units\u2014layers and layer widths\u2014in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation data set increases, as this is a sign of over-fitting to the training data set).\nThis simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset's error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when over-fitting has truly begun.\nFinally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set. If the data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test data set is also called a holdout data set. The term \"validation set\" is sometimes used instead of \"test set\" in some literature (e.g., if the original data set was partitioned into only two subsets, the test set might be referred to as the validation set).\nDeciding the sizes and strategies for data set division in training, test and validation sets is very dependent on the problem and data available."],"chatgpt_answers":["Training data is a set of data used to train a machine learning model. The goal of training a machine learning model is to find patterns in the training data that can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n\n\n\nIn order to train a machine learning model, you need to provide it with a large set of labeled examples.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Instrumental convergence\"","human_answers":["Instrumental convergence is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently intelligent beings (both human and non-human) to pursue similar sub-goals, even if their ultimate goals are quite different. More precisely, agents (beings with agency) may pursue instrumental goals\u2014goals which are made in pursuit of some particular end, but are not the end goals themselves\u2014without end, provided that their ultimate (intrinsic) goals may never be fully satisfied. Instrumental convergence posits that an intelligent agent with unbounded but apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example, a computer with the sole, unconstrained goal of solving an incredibly difficult mathematics problem like the Riemann hypothesis could attempt to turn the entire Earth into one giant computer in an effort to increase its computational power so that it can succeed in its calculations.\nProposed basic AI drives include utility function or goal-content integrity, self-protection, freedom from interference, self-improvement, and non-satiable acquisition of additional resources."],"chatgpt_answers":["Instrumental convergence refers to the process by which different agents or systems adopt similar strategies or behaviors in order to achieve their goals. This can occur when different agents are faced with similar constraints or incentives and adopt similar solutions in order to achieve their objectives. Instrumental convergence can lead to the emergence of common patterns of behavior or cultural norms in a group or society.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a group of farmers who are all trying to increase their crop yields. Each farmer may have different resources and techniques at their disposal, but they may all adopt similar strategies, such as using irrigation or fertilizers, in order to increase their yields. In this case, the farmers have converged on similar strategies as a result of their shared objective of increasing crop yields.\n\n\n\nInstrumental convergence can occur in many different contexts, including economic, social, and technological systems. It is often driven by the need to achieve efficiency or effectiveness in achieving a particular goal. Understanding the forces that drive instrumental convergence can be important for predicting and influencing the behavior of agents or systems."]}

One major challenge is that it is difficult to specify exactly what human values and interests are, and it is even more difficult to encode those values into an AI system. Additionally, there is a concern that an AI system that is designed to be friendly to humans may not be able to adapt to changing circumstances or unforeseen situations, which could lead to unintended consequences.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, some researchers and experts believe that building Friendly AI is an important goal, as the potential benefits of advanced AI systems could be enormous, but there is also a risk that an AI system could pose a threat to humanity if it is not aligned with human values and interests.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Amazon Web Services\"","human_answers":["Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. Often times, clients will use this in combination with autoscaling (a process that allows a client to use more compute in times of high application usage, and then scale down to reduce costs when there is less traffic). These cloud computing web services provide various services related to networking, compute, storage, middleware, IOT and other processing capacity, as well as software tools via AWS server farms.  This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems. \nOne of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console.  AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local\/RAM memory; hard-disk\/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).\nAWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a \"Pay-as-you-go\" model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber required availability, redundancy, security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either.

Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The screenplay is credited to Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, while co-writer William Wisher Jr. received an \"additional dialogue\" credit.\nCameron stated he devised the premise of the film from a fever dream he experienced during the release of his first film, Piranha II: The Spawning (1982), in Rome, and developed the concept in collaboration with Wisher. He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures, while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film's financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's commitments to Conan the Destroyer (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Aliens (1986).

When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias \"Neo\", uncovers the truth, he joins a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix.\nThe Matrix is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The film popularized a visual effect known as \"bullet time\", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed, allowing the sped-up movements of certain characters to be perceived normally.\nThe Matrix opened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value,[10][11] and was a massive success at the box office, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and the fourth highest-grossing film of that year. At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film won all four categories it was nominated for, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Best Sound Editing.

When communications are lost with a human colony on the moon where her crew first saw the alien creatures, Ripley agrees to return to the site with a unit of Colonial Marines to investigate. Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Carrie Henn feature in supporting roles.\nDespite the success of Alien, its sequel took years to develop due to lawsuits, a lack of enthusiasm from 20th Century Fox, and repeated changes in management. Although relatively inexperienced, Cameron was hired to write a story for Aliens in 1983 on the strength of his scripts for The Terminator (1984) and Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985). The project stalled again until new Fox executive Lawrence Gordon pursued a sequel. On an approximately $18.5\u00a0million budget, Aliens began principal photography in September 1985. Like its development, filming was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at Pinewood Studios. The difficult shoot affected the composer, James Horner, who was given little time to record the music.\nAliens was released on July 18, 1986, to critical acclaim. Reviewers praised its action, but some criticized the intensity of some scenes. Weaver's performance garnered consistent praise along with those of Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein.

In 2003, it was described as the world's best-selling science fiction novel.\nDune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs.  It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or \"spice\", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.\nHerbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.\nAdaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to a mostly negative response from critics and failed at the box office.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Principal Component Analysis\"","human_answers":["Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high number of dimensions\/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data. Formally, PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where (most of) the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points. Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science. The principal components of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n unit vectors, where the \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n-th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first \n\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i-1}\n\n vectors. Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line. These directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. Principal component analysis (PCA) is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.\nIn data analysis, the first principal component of a set of  \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n variables, presumed to be jointly normally distributed, is the derived variable formed as a linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance. The second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed, and we may proceed through  \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n iterations until all the variance is explained. PCA is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set.\nPCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n-th principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first \n\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i-1}\n\n principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data.\nFor either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Regularization (mathematics)\"","human_answers":["In mathematics, statistics, finance, computer science, particularly in machine learning and inverse problems, regularization is a process that changes the result answer to be \"simpler\". It is often used to obtain results for ill-posed problems or to prevent overfitting.\nAlthough regularization procedures can be divided in many ways, following delineation is particularly helpful:\nIn explicit regularization, independent of the problem or model, there is always a data term, that corresponds to a likelihood of the measurement and a regularization term that corresponds to a prior. By combining both using Bayesian statistics, one can compute a posterior, that includes both information sources and therefore stabilizes the estimation process. By trading off both objectives, one chooses to be more addictive to the data or to enforce generalization (to prevent overfitting). There is a whole research branch dealing with all possible regularizations. The work flow usually is, that one tries a specific regularization and then figures out the probability density that corresponds to that regularization to justify the choice. It can also be physically motivated by common sense or intuition.\nIn machine learning, the data term corresponds to the training data and the regularization is either the choice of the model or modifications to the algorithm. It is always intended to reduce the generalization error, i.e. the error score with the trained model on the evaluation set and not the training data.\nOne of the earliest uses of regularization is Tikhonov regularization, related to the method of least squares."],"chatgpt_answers":["In mathematics, regularization refers to the process of modifying a mathematical problem or equation in order to make it better-behaved or easier to solve. This is often done in order to avoid certain types of solutions that may be undesirable or undesirable, such as solutions that are not unique or solutions that produce divergent results.\n\n\n\nOne common example of regularization is the addition of a penalty term to an optimization problem. For example, suppose we have a function that we want to optimize, but we know that the solutions to the optimization problem may not be unique or may have undesirable properties. We can add a penalty term to the optimization problem that penalizes solutions that have these undesirable properties, which helps to steer the optimization towards solutions that are more desirable.\n\n\n\nAnother example of regularization is the use of smoothing techniques in data fitting and interpolation. When fitting a curve to a set of data points, it is often desirable to find a curve that is smooth and does not oscillate too much between points. By adding a penalty term to the optimization problem that penalizes the curvature or complexity of the curve, we can encourage the optimization algorithm to find a smoother curve that fits the data better.\n\n\n\nRegularization is a useful tool in many areas of mathematics, including machine learning, optimization, and signal processing, and it can help to improve the accuracy and stability of mathematical models."]}

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Mixture model\"","human_answers":["In statistics, a mixture model is a probabilistic model for representing the presence of subpopulations within an overall population, without requiring that an observed data set should identify the sub-population to which an individual observation belongs. Formally a mixture model corresponds to the mixture distribution that represents the probability distribution of observations in the overall population. However, while problems associated with \"mixture distributions\" relate to deriving the properties of the overall population from those of the sub-populations, \"mixture models\" are used to make statistical inferences about the properties of the sub-populations given only observations on the pooled population, without sub-population identity information.\nMixture models should not be confused with models for compositional data, i.e., data whose components are constrained to sum to a constant value (1, 100%, etc.). However, compositional models can be thought of as mixture models, where members of the population are sampled at random. Conversely, mixture models can be thought of as compositional models, where the total size reading population has been normalized to 1."],"chatgpt_answers":["A mixture model is a probabilistic model that represents a combination of multiple probability distributions. It is a flexible tool for modeling data that can be represented as a mixture of different underlying distributions.\n\n\n\nIn a mixture model, the data is assumed to be generated by a mixture of different probability distributions, rather than a single distribution. Each of these distributions is referred to as a component of the mixture model. The mixture model assigns a weight to each component, indicating the probability that a data point was generated by that component. The weights sum to 1, and they represent the probability that a data point was generated by each of the components.\n\n\n\nMixture models are commonly used in a variety of applications, including density estimation, clustering, and classification. They are particularly useful when the data exhibits complex structure or when it is not clear which probability distribution best describes the data.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a set of data points that represent the heights of individuals in a population. It is possible that the heights of the individuals in this population are distributed according to a normal distribution, but it is also possible that the distribution is more complex, with multiple modes or outliers. In this case, a mixture model could be used to model the data by fitting a normal distribution and an additional distribution to represent the complex structure of the data."]}

{"question":"Please explain what is \"National Security Agency\"","human_answers":["The National Security Agency (NSA) is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense, under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). The NSA is responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign and domestic intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, specializing in a discipline known as signals intelligence (SIGINT). The NSA is also tasked with the protection of U.S. communications networks and information systems. The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are clandestine.[10] The existence of the NSA was not revealed until 1975. The NSA has roughly 32,000 employees.[11]\nOriginating as a unit to decipher coded communications in World War II, it was officially formed as the NSA by President Harry S. Truman in 1952. Between then and the end of the Cold War, it became the largest of the U.S. intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget, but information available as of 2013 indicates that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) pulled ahead in this regard, with a budget of $14.7 billion.[12] The NSA currently conducts worldwide mass data collection and has been known to physically bug electronic systems as one method to this end.[13] The NSA is also alleged to have been behind such attack software as Stuxnet, which severely damaged Iran's nuclear program.[14][15] The NSA, alongside the CIA, maintains a physical presence in many countries across the globe; the CIA\/NSA joint Special Collection Service (a highly classified intelligence team) inserts eavesdropping devices in high value targets (such as presidential palaces or embassies). SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass \"close surveillance, burglary, wiretapping, [and] breaking and entering\".[16]\nUnlike the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage, the NSA does not publicly conduct human-source intelligence gathering. The NSA is entrusted with providing assistance to, and the coordination of, SIGINT elements for other government organizations \u2013 which are prevented by Executive Order from engaging in such activities on their own.[17] As part of these responsibilities, the agency has a co-located organization called the Central Security Service (CSS), which facilitates cooperation between the NSA and other U.S. defense cryptanalysis components. To further ensure streamlined communication between the signals intelligence community divisions, the NSA Director simultaneously serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and as Chief of the Central Security Service.\nThe NSA's actions have been a matter of political controversy on several occasions, including its spying on anti\u2013Vietnam War leaders and the agency's participation in economic espionage. In 2013, the NSA had many of its secret surveillance programs revealed to the public by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor. According to the leaked documents, the NSA intercepts and stores the communications of over a billion people worldwide, including United States citizens.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Long short-term memory\"","human_answers":["Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial neural network  used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, robot control, video games,[10] and healthcare.[11]\nThe name of LSTM refers to the analogy that a standard RNN has both \"long-term memory\" and \"short-term memory\". The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training, analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store long-term memories; the activation patterns in the network change once per time-step, analogous to how the moment-to-moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short-term memories.[12] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus \"long short-term memory\".\nA common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate[13] and a forget gate.[14] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.\nLSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[15] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.[citation needed]"],"chatgpt_answers":["Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited to model sequential data, such as time series or natural language.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Rule-based programming\"","human_answers":["Logic programming is a programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.  Major logic programming language families include Prolog, answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:\nand are read declaratively as logical implications:\nH is called the head of the rule and B1, ..., Bn is called the body. Facts are rules that have no body, and are written in the simplified form:\nIn the simplest case in which H, B1, ..., Bn are all atomic formulae, these clauses are called definite clauses or Horn clauses. However, there are many extensions of this simple case, the most important one being the case in which conditions in the body of a clause can also be negations of atomic formulas. Logic programming languages that include this extension have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.\nIn ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be controlled by the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures:\nConsider the following clause as an example:\nbased on an example used by Terry Winograd to illustrate the programming language Planner. As a clause in a logic program, it can be used both as a procedure to test whether X is fallible by testing whether X is human, and as a procedure to find an X which is fallible by finding an X which is human. Even facts have a procedural interpretation. For example, the clause:\ncan be used both as a procedure to show that socrates is human, and as a procedure to find an X that is human by \"assigning\" socrates to X.\nThe declarative reading of logic programs can be used by a programmer to verify their correctness.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Sparse matrix\"","human_answers":["In numerical analysis and scientific computing, a sparse matrix or sparse array is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. There is no strict definition regarding the proportion of zero-value elements for a matrix to qualify as sparse but a common criterion is that the number of non-zero elements is roughly equal to the number of rows or columns. By contrast, if most of the elements are non-zero, the matrix is considered dense. The number of zero-valued elements divided by the total number of elements (e.g., m \u00d7 n for an m \u00d7 n matrix) is sometimes referred to as the sparsity of the matrix.\nConceptually, sparsity corresponds to systems with few pairwise interactions. For example, consider a line of balls connected by springs from one to the next: this is a sparse system as only adjacent balls are coupled. By contrast, if the same line of balls were to have springs connecting each ball to all other balls, the system would correspond to a dense matrix. The concept of sparsity is useful in combinatorics and application areas such as network theory and numerical analysis, which typically have a low density of significant data or connections. Large sparse matrices often appear in scientific or engineering applications when solving partial differential equations.\nWhen storing and manipulating sparse matrices on a computer, it is beneficial and often necessary to use specialized algorithms and data structures that take advantage of the sparse structure of the matrix. Specialized computers have been made for sparse matrices, as they are common in the machine learning field. Operations using standard dense-matrix structures and algorithms are slow and inefficient when applied to large sparse matrices as processing and memory are wasted on the zeros. Sparse data is by nature more easily compressed and thus requires significantly less storage. Some very large sparse matrices are infeasible to manipulate using standard dense-matrix algorithms."],"chatgpt_answers":["A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Learning rate\"","human_answers":["In machine learning and statistics, the learning rate is a tuning parameter in an optimization algorithm that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. Since it influences to what extent newly acquired information overrides old information, it metaphorically represents the speed at which a machine learning model \"learns\". In the adaptive control literature, the learning rate is commonly referred to as gain.\nIn setting a learning rate, there is a trade-off between the rate of convergence and overshooting. While the descent direction is usually determined from the gradient of the loss function, the learning rate determines how big a step is taken in that direction. A too high learning rate will make the learning jump over minima but a too low learning rate will either take too long to converge or get stuck in an undesirable local minimum.\nIn order to achieve faster convergence, prevent oscillations and getting stuck in undesirable local minima the learning rate is often varied during training either in accordance to a learning rate schedule or by using an adaptive learning rate. The learning rate and its adjustments may also differ per parameter, in which case it is a diagonal matrix that can be interpreted as an approximation to the inverse of the Hessian matrix in Newton's method. The learning rate is related to the step length determined by inexact line search in quasi-Newton methods and related optimization algorithms.\nWhen conducting line searches, mini-batch sub-sampling (MBSS) affect the characteristics of the loss function along which the learning rate needs to be resolved. Static MBSS keeps the mini-batch fixed along a search direction, resulting in a smooth loss function along the search direction. Dynamic MBSS updates the mini-batch at every function evaluation, resulting in a point-wise discontinuous loss function along the search direction. Line searches that adaptively resolve learning rates for static MBSS loss functions include the parabolic approximation line (PAL) search. Line searches that adaptively resolve learning rates for dynamic MBSS loss functions include probabilistic line searches,[10] gradient-only line searches (GOLS)[11] and quadratic approximations.[12]"],"chatgpt_answers":["In machine learning, the learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at which the optimizer makes updates to the model parameters. It is a key factor in the training process of a neural network, as it controls how fast or slow the model learns.\n\n\n\nThe learning rate is usually set before training the model and remains constant throughout the training process. A larger learning rate means that the model will make larger updates to the model parameters with each training step, while a smaller learning rate means that the updates will be smaller.\n\n\n\nThere are a few different approaches to setting the learning rate. One approach is to manually set the learning rate to a fixed value, but this can be difficult because the optimal learning rate can vary widely depending on the specific model and dataset. A more common approach is to use a learning rate schedule, which adjusts the learning rate over time based on the performance of the model. For example, the learning rate may start off high and then gradually decrease as training progresses.\n\n\n\nIt's important to choose an appropriate learning rate, as a learning rate that is too high can cause the model to diverge and a learning rate that is too low can make the training process slow and inefficient.

These measures are called hyperparameters, and have to be tuned so that the model can optimally solve the machine learning problem.

Choosing the right hyperparameters can make a big difference in the accuracy and efficiency of a model. There are several methods that can be used to optimize hyperparameters, including manual tuning, grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.\n\n\n\nIn manual tuning, the hyperparameters are selected by the practitioner based on their experience and knowledge of the problem.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Vector space\"","human_answers":["In mathematics and physics, a vector space (also called a linear space) is a set whose elements, often called vectors, may be added together and multiplied (\"scaled\") by numbers called scalars. Scalars are often real numbers, but can be  complex numbers or, more generally, elements of any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called vector axioms. The terms real vector space and complex vector space are often used to specify the nature of the scalars: real coordinate space or complex coordinate space.\nVector spaces generalize Euclidean vectors, which allow modeling of physical quantities, such as forces and velocity, that have not only a magnitude, but also a direction. The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for linear algebra, together with the concept of matrix, which allows computing in vector spaces. This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating and studying systems of linear equations.\nVector spaces are characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. This means that, for two vector spaces with the same dimension, the properties that depend only on the vector-space structure are exactly the same (technically the vector spaces are isomorphic). A vector space is finite-dimensional if its dimension is a natural number. Otherwise, it is infinite-dimensional, and its dimension is an infinite cardinal. Finite-dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in geometry and related areas. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics. For example, polynomial rings are countably infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and many function spaces have the cardinality of the continuum as a dimension.\nMany vector spaces that are considered in mathematics are also endowed with other structures.

They were developed over several decades of progressively building the theories, from 1822 (Navier) to 1842\u20131850 (Stokes).\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations mathematically express conservation of momentum and conservation of mass for Newtonian fluids. They are sometimes accompanied by an equation of state relating pressure, temperature  and density. They arise from applying Isaac Newton's second law to fluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (proportional to the gradient of velocity) and a pressure term\u2014hence describing viscous flow. The difference between them and the closely related Euler equations is that Navier\u2013Stokes equations take viscosity into account while the Euler equations model only inviscid flow. As a result, the Navier\u2013Stokes are a parabolic equation and therefore have better analytic properties, at the expense of having less mathematical structure (e.g. they are never completely integrable).\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Deductive reasoning\"","human_answers":["Deductive reasoning is the mental process of drawing deductive inferences. An inference is deductively valid if its conclusion follows logically from its premises, i.e. if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. For example, the inference from the premises \"all men are mortal\" and \"Socrates is a man\" to the conclusion \"Socrates is mortal\" is deductively valid. An argument is sound if it is valid and all its premises are true. Some theorists define deduction in terms of the intentions of the author: they have to intend for the premises to offer deductive support to the conclusion. With the help of this modification, it is possible to distinguish valid from invalid deductive reasoning: it is invalid if the author's belief about the deductive support is false, but even invalid deductive reasoning is a form of deductive reasoning. \nPsychology is interested in deductive reasoning as a psychological process, i.e. how people actually draw inferences. Logic, on the other hand, focuses on the deductive relation of logical consequence between the premises and the conclusion or how people should draw inferences. There are different ways of conceptualizing this relation. According to the semantic approach, an argument is deductively valid if and only if there is no possible interpretation of this argument where its premises are true and its conclusion is false. The syntactic approach, on the other hand, holds that an argument is deductively valid if and only if its conclusion can be deduced from its premises using a valid rule of inference. A rule of inference is a schema of drawing a conclusion from a set of premises based only on their logical form. There are various rules of inference, like the modus ponens and the modus tollens. Invalid deductive arguments, which do not follow a rule of inference, are called formal fallacies. Rules of inference are definitory rules and contrast to strategic rules, which specify what inferences one needs to draw in order to arrive at an intended conclusion. Deductive reasoning contrasts with non-deductive or ampliative reasoning. For ampliative arguments, like inductive or abductive arguments, the premises offer weaker support to their conclusion: they make it more likely but they do not guarantee its truth. They make up for this drawback by being able to provide genuinely new information not already found in the premises, unlike deductive arguments.\nCognitive psychology investigates the mental processes responsible for deductive reasoning. One of its topics concerns the factors determining whether people draw valid or invalid deductive inferences. One factor is the form of the argument: for example, people are more successful for arguments of the form modus ponens than for modus tollens. Another is the content of the arguments: people are more likely to believe that an argument is valid if the claim made in its conclusion is plausible. A general finding is that people tend to perform better for realistic and concrete cases than for abstract cases. Psychological theories of deductive reasoning aim to explain these findings by providing an account of the underlying psychological processes. Mental logic theories hold that deductive reasoning is a language-like process that happens through the manipulation of representations using rules of inference. Mental model theories, on the other hand, claim that deductive reasoning involves models of possible states of the world without the medium of language or rules of inference. According to dual-process theories of reasoning, there are two qualitatively different cognitive systems responsible for reasoning.\nThe problem of deductive reasoning is relevant to various fields and issues. Epistemology tries to understand how justification is transferred from the belief in the premises to the belief in the conclusion in the process of deductive reasoning. Probability logic studies how the probability of the premises of an inference affects the probability of its conclusion. The controversial thesis of deductivism denies that there are other correct forms of inference besides deduction. Natural deduction is a type of proof system based on simple and self-evident rules of inference. In philosophy, the geometrical method is a way of philosophizing that starts from a small set of self-evident axioms and tries to build a comprehensive logical system using deductive reasoning."],"chatgpt_answers":["Deductive reasoning is a method of logical thinking in which a conclusion is drawn based on the relationship between two or more premises. This type of reasoning starts with a general statement, or premise, and applies it to a specific situation to arrive at a logical conclusion.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider the following argument:\n\n\n\nPremise 1: All birds can fly.\n\nPremise 2: Eagles are birds.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, eagles can fly.\n\n\n\nIn this example, the conclusion that eagles can fly is drawn based on the relationship between the two premises: that all birds can fly and that eagles are birds. The conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\n\n\nDeductive reasoning is often contrasted with inductive reasoning, which involves drawing conclusions based on observations or specific examples. While deductive reasoning is a reliable method for arriving at conclusions when the premises are true, it is not always possible to determine the truth of the premises with certainty. In such cases, the conclusion may not necessarily be reliable."]}

Along with its sister papers The Observer and The Guardian Weekly, The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group, owned by the Scott Trust. The trust was created in 1936 to \"secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference\". The trust was converted into a limited company in 2008, with a constitution written so as to maintain for The Guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators.

The newspaper has an online edition, TheGuardian.com, as well as two international websites, Guardian Australia (founded in 2013) and Guardian US (founded in 2011). The paper's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion,[12][13] and the term \"Guardian reader\" is used to imply a stereotype of liberal, left-wing or \"politically correct\" views. Frequent typographical errors during the age of manual typesetting led Private Eye magazine to dub the paper the \"Grauniad\" in the 1960s, a nickname still used occasionally by the editors for self-mockery.[14]\nIn an Ipsos MORI research poll in September 2018 designed to interrogate the public's trust of specific titles online, The Guardian scored highest for digital-content news, with 84% of readers agreeing that they \"trust what [they] see in it\".[15] A December 2018 report of a poll by the Publishers Audience Measurement Company stated that the paper's print edition was found to be the most trusted in the UK in the period from October 2017 to September 2018. It was also reported to be the most-read of the UK's \"quality newsbrands\", including digital editions; other \"quality\" brands included The Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, and the i. While The Guardian's print circulation is in decline, the report indicated that news from The Guardian, including that reported online, reaches more than 23 million UK adults each month.[16]\nChief among the notable \"scoops\" obtained by the paper was the 2011 News International phone-hacking scandal\u2014and in particular the hacking of the murdered English teenager Milly Dowler's phone.[17] The investigation led to the closure of the News of the World, the UK's best-selling Sunday newspaper and one of the highest-circulation newspapers in history.[18] In June 2013, The Guardian broke news of the secret collection by the Obama administration of Verizon telephone records,[19] and subsequently revealed the existence of the surveillance program PRISM after knowledge of it was leaked to the paper by the whistleblower and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.[20] In 2016, The Guardian led an investigation into the Panama Papers, exposing then\u2013Prime Minister David Cameron's links to offshore bank accounts.

Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the \"knowledge discovery in databases\" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.\nThe term \"data mining\" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics\u2014or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning\u2014are more appropriate.\nThe actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Data mining\"","human_answers":["Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the \"knowledge discovery in databases\" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.\nThe term \"data mining\" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics\u2014or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning\u2014are more appropriate.\nThe actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.\nThe difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]\nThe related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered.

Imaging techniques in X-ray, MRI, Endoscopy, and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time. CAD systems process digital images or videos for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.\nCAD also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of whole-slide imaging and machine learning algorithms. So far its application has been limited to quantifying immunostaining but is also being investigated for the standard H&E stain.\nCAD is an interdisciplinary technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing. A typical application is the detection of a tumor. For instance, some hospitals use CAD to support preventive medical check-ups in mammography (diagnosis of breast cancer), the detection of polyps in Colonoscopy, and lung cancer.\nComputer-aided detection (CADe) systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.\nAlthough CAD has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years, CAD usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional, but rather plays a supporting role. The professional (generally a radiologist) is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image. However, the goal of some CAD systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot, as in diabetic retinopathy, architectural distortion in mammograms, ground-glass nodules in thoracic CT, and non-polypoid (\u201cflat\u201d) lesions in CT colonography."],"chatgpt_answers":["Automated medical diagnosis is the use of computer algorithms and software to analyze medical data and provide a diagnosis without the need for human intervention.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Symbolic artificial intelligence\"","human_answers":["In artificial intelligence, symbolic artificial intelligence is the term for the collection of all methods in artificial intelligence research that are based on high-level symbolic (human-readable) representations of problems, logic and search. Symbolic AI used tools such as logic programming, production rules, semantic nets and frames, and it developed applications such as knowledge-based systems (in particular, expert systems),  symbolic mathematics, automated theorem provers, ontologies, the semantic web, and automated planning and scheduling systems. The Symbolic AI paradigm led to seminal ideas in search, symbolic programming languages, agents, multi-agent systems, the semantic web, and the strengths and limitations of formal knowledge and reasoning systems.\nSymbolic AI was the dominant paradigm of AI research from the mid-1950s until the middle 1990s. \nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the ultimate goal of their field. An early boom, with early successes such as the Logic Theorist and Samuel's Checker's Playing Program led to unrealistic expectations and promises and was followed by the First AI Winter as funding dried up. A second boom (1969\u20131986) occurred with the rise of expert systems, their promise of capturing corporate expertise, and an enthusiastic corporate embrace. That boom, and some early successes, e.g., with XCON at DEC, was followed again by later disappointment. Problems with difficulties in knowledge acquisition, maintaining large knowledge bases, and brittleness in handling out-of-domain problems arose. Another, second, AI Winter (1988\u20132011) followed. Subsequently, AI researchers focused on addressing underlying problems in handling uncertainty and in knowledge acquisition.[10] Uncertainty was addressed with formal methods such as hidden Markov models, Bayesian reasoning, and statistical relational learning.[11][12] Symbolic machine learning addressed the knowledge acquisition problem with contributions including Version Space, Valiant's PAC learning, Quinlan's ID3 decision-tree learning, case-based learning, and inductive logic programming to learn relations.[10]\nNeural networks, a sub-symbolic approach, had been pursued from early days and was to reemerge strongly in 2012.  Early examples are Rosenblatt's perceptron learning work, the backpropagation work of Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams,[13] and work in convolutional neural networks by LeCun et al. in 1989.[14] However, neural networks were not viewed as successful until about 2012: \"Until Big Data became commonplace, the general consensus in the Al community was that the so-called neural-network approach was hopeless. Systems just didn't work that well, compared to other methods. ... A revolution came in 2012, when a number of people, including a team of researchers working with Hinton, worked out a way to use the power of GPUs to enormously increase the power of neural networks.\"[15] Over the next several years, deep learning had spectacular success in handling vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, image generation, and machine translation. However, since 2020, as inherent difficulties with bias, explanation, comprehensibility, and robustness became more apparent with deep learning approaches; an increasing number of AI researchers have called for combining the best of both the symbolic and neural network approaches[16][17] and addressing areas that both approaches have difficulty with, such as common-sense reasoning.[15]"],"chatgpt_answers":["Symbolic artificial intelligence (also known as \"classical AI\" or \"good old-fashioned artificial intelligence\" (GOFAI)) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the use of symbolic representations and reasoning to solve problems.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Probability theory\"","human_answers":["Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability. Although there are several different probability interpretations, probability theory treats the concept in a rigorous mathematical manner by expressing it through a set of axioms. Typically these axioms formalise probability in terms of a probability space, which assigns a measure taking values between 0 and 1, termed the probability measure, to a set of outcomes called the sample space. Any specified subset of the sample space is called an event.\nCentral subjects in probability theory include discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, and stochastic processes (which provide mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic or uncertain processes or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in a random fashion).\nAlthough it is not possible to perfectly predict random events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.\nAs a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of data. Methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in statistical mechanics or sequential estimation.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Loss function\"","human_answers":["In mathematical optimization and decision theory, a loss function or cost function (sometimes also called an error function)  is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some \"cost\" associated with the event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. An objective function is either a loss function or its opposite (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be maximized. The loss function could include terms from several levels of the hierarchy.\nIn statistics, typically a  loss function is used for parameter estimation, and the event in question is some function of the difference between estimated and true values for an instance of data. The concept, as old as Laplace, was reintroduced in statistics by Abraham Wald in the middle of the 20th century.  In the context of economics, for example, this is usually economic cost or regret.  In classification, it is the penalty for an incorrect classification of an example. In actuarial science, it is used in an insurance context to model benefits paid over premiums, particularly since the works of Harald Cram\u00e9r in the 1920s.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Array data structure\"","human_answers":["In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.\nFor example, an array of ten 32-bit (4-byte) integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as ten words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, ..., 2036, (in hexadecimal: 0x7D0, 0x7D4, 0x7D8, ..., 0x7F4) so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + (i \u00d7 4).\nThe memory address of the first element of an array is called first address, foundation address, or base address.\nBecause the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called \"matrices\". In some cases the term \"vector\" is used in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are the more mathematically correct equivalent. Tables are often implemented in the form of arrays, especially lookup tables; the word \"table\" is sometimes used as a synonym of array.\nArrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings. They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses. Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.\nArrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array. For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually, but not always, fixed while the array is in use.\nThe term \"array\" may also refer to an array data type, a kind of data type provided by most high-level programming languages that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time. Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures.\nThe term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or \"abstract array\", a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays."],"chatgpt_answers":["An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items, typically in a contiguous block of memory. The items in an array are usually of the same data type, and are accessed using an index.\n\n\n\nIn many programming languages, an array is implemented as a fixed-size sequenced collection of elements of the same data type. Each element in the array is assigned a unique index, which is used to identify and access the element. The first element in the array is assigned an index of 0, the second element is assigned an index of 1, and so on.\n\n\n\nHere is an example of how you might declare and initialize an array of integers in C:\n\n\n\nCopy code\n\nint numbers[5];\n\nnumbers[0] = 10;\n\nnumbers[1] = 20;\n\nnumbers[2] = 30;\n\nnumbers[3] = 40;\n\nnumbers[4] = 50;\n\nIn this example, we have declared an array called numbers that can hold 5 integers. We have then initialized the array by assigning values to each element in the array. We can access the elements of the array using their indexes, like this:\n\n\n\nCopy code\n\nprintf(\"%d\", numbers[0]);  \/\/ prints 10\n\nprintf(\"%d\", numbers[2]);  \/\/ prints 30\n\nArrays are a useful data structure for storing and manipulating large amounts of data, but they have some limitations. For example, the size of an array is fixed when it is created, so you cannot easily add or remove elements from the array. In addition, arrays are not well-suited for inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the collection. For these types of operations, you might want to consider using a different data structure such as a linked list."]}

Probability density  is the  probability per unit length,  in other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there is an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more likely it is that the random variable would be close to one sample compared to the other sample.\nIn a more precise sense, the PDF is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values, as opposed to taking on any one value.

PCA is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set.\nPCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The \n\n\n\ni\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i}\n\n-th principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first \n\n\n\ni\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle i-1}\n\n principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data.\nFor either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA).

This problem setup also allows the dimensionality of the signals being represented to be higher than the one of the signals being observed. The above two properties lead to having seemingly redundant atoms that allow multiple representations of the same signal but also provide an improvement in sparsity and flexibility of the representation.\nOne of the most important applications of sparse dictionary learning is in the field of compressed sensing or signal recovery. In compressed sensing, a high-dimensional signal can be recovered with only a few linear measurements provided that the signal is sparse or nearly sparse.

Once a matrix or a high dimensional vector is transferred to a sparse space, different recovery algorithms like basis pursuit, CoSaMP or fast non-iterative algorithms can be used to recover the signal.\nOne of the key principles of dictionary learning is that the dictionary has to be inferred from the input data. The emergence of sparse dictionary learning methods was stimulated by the fact that in signal processing one typically wants to represent the input data using as few components as possible.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Image de-noising\"","human_answers":["Noise reduction is the process of removing noise from a signal. Noise reduction techniques exist for audio and images. Noise reduction algorithms may distort the signal to some degree. Noise rejection is the ability of a circuit to isolate an undesired signal component from the desired signal component, as with common-mode rejection ratio.\nAll signal processing devices, both analog and digital, have traits that make them susceptible to noise. Noise can be random with an even frequency distribution (white noise), or frequency-dependent noise introduced by a device's mechanism or signal processing algorithms.\nIn electronic systems, a major type of noise is hiss created by random electron motion due to thermal agitation. These agitated electrons rapidly add and subtract from the output signal and thus create detectable noise.\nIn the case of photographic film and magnetic tape, noise (both visible and audible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity, more sensitive film having larger-sized grains. In magnetic tape, the larger the grains of the magnetic particles (usually ferric oxide or magnetite), the more prone the medium is to noise. To compensate for this, larger areas of film or magnetic tape may be used to lower the noise to an acceptable level."],"chatgpt_answers":["Image de-noising is the process of removing noise from an image.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Market basket analysis\"","human_answers":["Affinity analysis falls under the umbrella term of data mining which uncovers meaningful correlations between different entities according to their co-occurrence in a data set. In almost all systems and processes, the application of affinity analysis can extract significant knowledge about the unexpected trends. In fact, affinity analysis takes advantages of studying attributes that go together which helps uncover the hidden pattens in a big data through generating association rules. Association rules mining procedure is two-fold: first, it finds all frequent attributes in a data set and, then generates association rules satisfying some predefined criteria, support and confidence, to identify the most important relationships in the frequent itemset. The first step in the process is to count the co-occurrence of attributes in the data set. Next, a subset is created called the frequent itemset. The association rules mining takes the form of if a condition or feature (A) is present then another condition or feature (B) exists. The first condition or feature (A) is called antecedent and the latter (B) is known as consequent. This process is repeated until no additional frequent itemsets are found.\u00a0 There are two important metrics for performing the association rules mining technique: support and confidence. Also, a priori algorithm is used to reduce the search space for the problem.\nThe support metric in the association rule learning algorithm is defined as the frequency of the antecedent or consequent appearing together in a data set. Moreover, confidence is expressed as the reliability of the association rules determined by the ratio of the data records containing both A and B. The minimum threshold for support and confidence are inputs to the model. Considering all the above-mentioned definitions, affinity analysis can develop rules that will predict the occurrence of an event based on the occurrence of other events. This data mining method has been explored in different fields including disease diagnosis, market basket analysis, retail industry, higher education, and financial analysis. In retail, affinity analysis is used to perform market basket analysis, in which retailers seek to understand the purchase behavior of customers.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Web usage mining\"","human_answers":["Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the \"knowledge discovery in databases\" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.\nThe term \"data mining\" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics\u2014or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning\u2014are more appropriate.\nThe actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.\nThe difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]\nThe related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Logic programming\"","human_answers":["Logic programming is a programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.  Major logic programming language families include Prolog, answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:\nand are read declaratively as logical implications:\nH is called the head of the rule and B1, ..., Bn is called the body. Facts are rules that have no body, and are written in the simplified form:\nIn the simplest case in which H, B1, ..., Bn are all atomic formulae, these clauses are called definite clauses or Horn clauses. However, there are many extensions of this simple case, the most important one being the case in which conditions in the body of a clause can also be negations of atomic formulas. Logic programming languages that include this extension have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.\nIn ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be controlled by the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures:\nConsider the following clause as an example:\nbased on an example used by Terry Winograd to illustrate the programming language Planner. As a clause in a logic program, it can be used both as a procedure to test whether X is fallible by testing whether X is human, and as a procedure to find an X which is fallible by finding an X which is human. Even facts have a procedural interpretation. For example, the clause:\ncan be used both as a procedure to show that socrates is human, and as a procedure to find an X that is human by \"assigning\" socrates to X.\nThe declarative reading of logic programs can be used by a programmer to verify their correctness.

It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.\nIn functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.\nFunctional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely functional programming, a subset of functional programming which treats all functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects. This is in contrast with impure procedures, common in imperative programming, which can have side effects (such as modifying the program's state or taking input from a user). Proponents of purely functional programming claim that by restricting side effects, programs can have fewer bugs, be easier to debug and test, and be more suited to formal verification.\nFunctional programming has its roots in academia, evolving from the lambda calculus, a formal system of computation based only on functions.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Mathematical induction\"","human_answers":["Mathematical induction is a method for proving that a statement P(n) is true for every natural number n, that is, that the infinitely many cases P(0), P(1), P(2), P(3), ...\u2009 all hold. Informal metaphors help to explain this technique, such as falling dominoes or climbing a ladder:\nA proof by induction consists of two cases. The first, the base case, proves the statement for n\u00a0=\u00a00 without assuming any knowledge of other cases. The second case, the induction step, proves that if the statement holds for any given case n\u00a0=\u00a0k, then it must also hold for the next case n\u00a0=\u00a0k\u00a0+\u20091. These two steps establish that the statement holds for every natural number n. The base case does not necessarily begin with n\u00a0=\u00a00, but often with n\u00a0=\u00a01, and possibly with any fixed natural number n\u00a0=\u00a0N, establishing the truth of the statement for all natural numbers n\u00a0\u2265\u00a0N.\nThe method can be extended to prove statements about more general well-founded structures, such as trees; this generalization, known as structural induction, is used in mathematical logic and computer science. Mathematical induction in this extended sense is closely related to recursion. Mathematical induction is an inference rule used in formal proofs, and is the foundation of most correctness proofs for computer programs.\nAlthough its name may suggest otherwise, mathematical induction should not be confused with inductive reasoning as used in philosophy (see Problem of induction). The mathematical method examines infinitely many cases to prove a general statement, but does so by a finite chain of deductive reasoning involving the variable n, which can take infinitely many values."],"chatgpt_answers":["Mathematical induction is a method of proof that is used to establish that a given statement is true for all natural numbers (positive integers). It is based on the idea that if a statement is true for the base case (usually 0 or 1), and if the statement is true for one natural number, then it must be true for the next natural number. This process is then repeated until the statement has been proven for all natural numbers.\n\n\n\nTo prove a statement using mathematical induction, you must first prove that the statement is true for the base case. For example, if you want to prove that the statement \"for all natural numbers n, the sum of the first n natural numbers is equal to n(n+1)\/2\" is true, you would need to prove that it is true for the base case n = 0. In this case, the sum of the first 0 natural numbers is 0, and 0(0+1)\/2 = 0, so the statement is true for the base case.\n\n\n\nOnce you have proved that the statement is true for the base case, you must then assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number, say k. Using this assumption, you must then prove that the statement must be true for the next natural number, k+1. For example, if you are trying to prove the statement above, you would assume that the sum of the first k natural numbers is equal to k(k+1)\/2, and then use this assumption to prove that the sum of the first k+1 natural numbers is equal to (k+1)(k+2)\/2.\n\n\n\nIf you can successfully prove the statement for the base case and for the next natural number, then you can use mathematical induction to conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers. This is because the base case and the next natural number are both true, and if the statement is true for one natural number, it must also be true for the next natural number, and so on. Therefore, by repeating this process indefinitely, you can prove that the statement is true for all natural numbers."]}

Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root node, which has no parent. These constraints mean there are no cycles or \"loops\" (no node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be treated like the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful technique for tree traversal.

The feature map in kernel machines is infinite dimensional but only requires a finite dimensional matrix from user-input according to the Representer theorem. Kernel machines are slow to compute for datasets larger than a couple of thousand examples without parallel processing. \nKernel methods  owe their name to the use of kernel functions, which enable them to operate in a high-dimensional, implicit feature space without ever computing the coordinates of the data in that space, but rather by simply computing the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in the feature space.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Linear regression\"","human_answers":["In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.\nIn linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models. Most commonly, the conditional mean of the response given the values of the explanatory variables (or predictors) is assumed to be an affine function of those values; less commonly, the conditional median or some other quantile is used. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response given the values of the predictors, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all of these variables, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.\nLinear regression was the first type of regression analysis to be studied rigorously, and to be used extensively in practical applications. This is because models which depend linearly on their unknown parameters are easier to fit than models which are non-linearly related to their parameters and because the statistical properties of the resulting estimators are easier to determine.\nLinear regression has many practical uses. Most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories:\nLinear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach, but they may also be fitted in other ways, such as by minimizing the \"lack of fit\" in some other norm (as with least absolute deviations regression), or by minimizing a penalized version of the least squares cost function as in ridge regression (L2-norm penalty) and lasso (L1-norm penalty). Conversely, the least squares approach can be used to fit models that are not linear models. Thus, although the terms \"least squares\" and \"linear model\" are closely linked, they are not synonymous."],"chatgpt_answers":["Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

The equation has the form:\n\n\n\ny = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bn*xn\n\n\n\nwhere y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables, and b0, b1, b2, ..., bn are the regression coefficients.

However, it is important to tune the penalty hyperparameter to ensure that the model is not over- or under-regularized.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Natural selection\"","human_answers":["Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations. Charles Darwin popularised the term \"natural selection\", contrasting it with artificial selection, which in his view is intentional, whereas natural selection is not.\nVariation exists within all populations of organisms. This occurs partly because random mutations arise in the genome of an individual organism, and their offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout the lives of the individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic environment. Because individuals with certain variants of the trait tend to survive and reproduce more than individuals with other less successful variants, the population evolves. Other factors affecting reproductive success include sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection.\nNatural selection acts on the phenotype, the characteristics of the organism which actually interact with the environment, but the genetic\n(heritable) basis of any phenotype that gives that phenotype a reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation  (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a population.\nNatural selection is a cornerstone of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution."],"chatgpt_answers":["Natural selection is a process that occurs in nature as a result of certain inherited traits being more or less advantageous for an individual's survival and reproduction in a particular environment. These advantageous traits tend to be passed on to future generations, while disadvantageous traits tend to be selected against and are less likely to be passed on. This process ultimately leads to the evolution of species over time.\n\n\n\nThe theory of natural selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century, and it remains one of the most important concepts in the field of biology. According to the theory, natural selection occurs because individuals within a population vary in their traits, and some of these traits are more advantageous than others in a particular environment. For example, a population of gazelles that live in a grassland habitat may have individuals with longer legs, which allow them to run faster and escape from predators more effectively. These individuals would be more likely to survive and reproduce, and as a result, the trait of long legs would be more common in the population over time.\n\n\n\nNatural selection is one of the main mechanisms of evolution, and it has shaped the diversity of life on Earth as we know it today."]}
{"question":"Please explain what is \"Crossover (genetic algorithm)\"","human_answers":["In genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation, crossover, also called recombination, is a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring. It is one way to stochastically generate new solutions from an existing population, and is analogous to the crossover that happens during sexual reproduction in biology. Solutions can also be generated by cloning an existing solution, which is analogous to asexual reproduction. Newly generated solutions are typically mutated before being added to the population.\nDifferent algorithms in evolutionary computation may use different data structures to store genetic information, and each genetic representation can be recombined with different crossover operators. Typical data structures that can be recombined with crossover are bit arrays, vectors of real numbers, or trees."],"chatgpt_answers":["In a genetic algorithm, crossover is a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to produce offspring that inherits characteristics from both parents. Crossover is a key component of genetic algorithms because it allows the algorithm to mix and recombine the characteristics of different solutions, leading to the discovery of new, potentially better solutions.\n\n\n\nCrossover works by selecting a point in the genetic material of the two parents, known as a crossover point, and swapping the genetic material on either side of the point between the two parents to create two new offspring. For example, if the parents have the following genetic material:\n\n\n\nParent 1: [A B C D E F G]\n\nParent 2: [H I J K L M N]\n\n\n\nCrossover point: 4\n\n\n\nOffspring 1: [A B C H I J K]\n\nOffspring 2: [D E F L M N G]\n\n\n\nIn this example, the crossover point is chosen at position 4 in the genetic material of the two parents, and the genetic material on either side of the point is swapped to create two new offspring. Offspring 1 inherits the first four elements from Parent 1 and the last three elements from Parent 2, while Offspring 2 inherits the first three elements from Parent 2 and the last four elements from Parent 1.\n\n\n\nCrossover is typically used in combination with other genetic operators, such as mutation, to explore the space of possible solutions and find the best one.

Where white-box testing is design-driven, that is, driven exclusively by agreed specifications of how each component of software is required to behave (as in DO-178C and ISO 26262 processes), white-box test techniques can accomplish assessment for unimplemented or missing requirements.\nWhite-box test design techniques include the following code coverage criteria:"],"chatgpt_answers":["White-box testing is a method of testing software in which the tester has complete knowledge of the internal workings and structure of the system being tested.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Test set\"","human_answers":["In machine learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms function by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a mathematical model from input data. These input data used to build the model are usually divided in multiple data sets. In particular, three data sets are commonly used in different stages of the creation of the model: training, validation and test sets.\nThe model is initially fit on a training data set, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters (e.g. weights of connections between neurons in artificial neural networks) of the model. The model (e.g. a naive Bayes classifier) is trained on the training data set using a supervised learning method, for example using optimization methods such as gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. In practice, the training data set often consists of pairs of an input vector (or scalar) and the corresponding output vector (or scalar), where the answer key is commonly denoted as the target (or label). The current model is run with the training data set and produces a result, which is then compared with the target, for each input vector in the training data set. Based on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm being used, the parameters of the model are adjusted. The model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation.\nSuccessively, the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in a second data set called the validation data set. The validation data set provides an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training data set while tuning the model's hyperparameters (e.g. the number of hidden units\u2014layers and layer widths\u2014in a neural network). Validation datasets can be used for regularization by early stopping (stopping training when the error on the validation data set increases, as this is a sign of over-fitting to the training data set).\nThis simple procedure is complicated in practice by the fact that the validation dataset's error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when over-fitting has truly begun.\nFinally, the test data set is a data set used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training data set. If the data in the test data set has never been used in training (for example in cross-validation), the test data set is also called a holdout data set. The term \"validation set\" is sometimes used instead of \"test set\" in some literature (e.g., if the original data set was partitioned into only two subsets, the test set might be referred to as the validation set).\nDeciding the sizes and strategies for data set division in training, test and validation sets is very dependent on the problem and data available."],"chatgpt_answers":["A test set is a set of data used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model.

It is mainly used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice.  In a prediction problem, a model is usually given a dataset of known data on which training is run (training dataset), and a dataset of unknown data (or first seen data) against which the model is tested (called the validation dataset or testing set). The goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data that was not used in estimating it, in order to flag problems like overfitting or selection bias[10] and to give an insight on how the model will generalize to an independent dataset (i.e., an unknown dataset, for instance from a real problem).\nOne round of cross-validation involves partitioning a sample of data into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset (called the training set), and validating the analysis on the other subset (called the validation set or testing set). To reduce variability, in most methods multiple rounds of cross-validation are performed using different partitions, and the validation results are combined (e.g. averaged) over the rounds to give an estimate of the model's predictive performance.\nIn summary, cross-validation combines (averages) measures of fitness in prediction to derive a more accurate estimate of model prediction performance.[11]"],"chatgpt_answers":["Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. It involves dividing a dataset into a training set, which is used to train the model, and a test set, which is used to evaluate the model. The idea behind cross-validation is to use a portion of the data for training and a different portion for testing, and to repeat this process multiple times in order to get a better estimate of the model's performance.\n\n\n\nThere are several different types of cross-validation, including:\n\n\n\nK-fold cross-validation: In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds. The model is trained on k-1 folds, and the remaining fold is used as the test set. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold being used as the test set each time. The final performance measure is the average of the performance measures obtained on each of the k folds.\n\n\n\nLeave-one-out cross-validation: In leave-one-out cross-validation, the model is trained on all but one of the data points, and the remaining point is used as the test set.

The final performance measure is the average of the performance measures obtained on each of the k test sets.\n\n\n\nStratified k-fold cross-validation: In stratified k-fold cross-validation, the data is divided into k folds, but the folds are stratified to ensure that each fold has a representative proportion of each class. This is particularly useful when the classes in the dataset are imbalanced (i.e., there are significantly more examples of one class than the other).\n\n\n\nCross-validation is a widely used technique for evaluating the performance of machine learning models because it helps to reduce the risk of overfitting (i.e., the model performing well on the training data but poorly on unseen data). By training the model on different subsets of the data and evaluating its performance on different test sets, we can get a more robust estimate of the model's generalization ability."]}

In a diagnostic test, sensitivity is a measure of how well a test can identify true positives and specificity is a measure of how well a test can identify true negatives. For all testing, both diagnostic and screening, there is usually a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, such that higher sensitivities will mean lower specificities and vice versa.\nIf the goal is to return the ratio at which the test identifies the percentage of people highly likely to be identified as having the condition, the number of true positives should be high and the number of false negatives should be very low, which results in high sensitivity.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Receiver operating characteristic\"","human_answers":["A receiver operating characteristic curve, or ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.  The method was originally developed for operators of military radar receivers starting in 1941, which led to its name.\nThe ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or probability of detection.[10] The false-positive rate is also known as probability of false alarm[10] and can be calculated as (1 \u2212 specificity). The ROC can also be thought of as a plot of the power as a function of the Type I Error of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity or recall as a function of fall-out. In general, if the probability distributions for both detection and false alarm are known, the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the cumulative distribution function (area under the probability distribution from \n\n\n\n\u2212\n\u221e\n\n\n{\\displaystyle -\\infty }\n\n to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false-alarm probability on the x-axis.\nROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Chemical synapse\"","human_answers":["Chemical synapses are biological junctions through which neurons' signals can be sent to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands. Chemical synapses allow neurons to form circuits within the central nervous system. They are crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought. They allow the nervous system to connect to and control other systems of the body.\nAt a chemical synapse, one neuron releases neurotransmitter molecules into a small space (the synaptic cleft) that is adjacent to another neuron. The neurotransmitters are contained within small sacs called synaptic vesicles, and are released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis. These molecules then bind to neurotransmitter receptors on the postsynaptic cell. Finally, the neurotransmitters are cleared from the synapse through one of several potential mechanisms including enzymatic degradation or re-uptake by specific transporters either on the presynaptic cell or on some other neuroglia to terminate the action of the neurotransmitter.\nThe adult human brain is estimated to contain from 1014 to 5 \u00d7 1014 (100\u2013500 trillion) synapses.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Hardware acceleration\"","human_answers":["Hardware acceleration is the use of computer hardware designed to perform specific functions more efficiently when compared to software running on a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU). Any transformation of data that can be calculated in software running on a generic CPU can also be calculated in custom-made hardware, or in some mix of both.\nTo perform computing tasks more quickly (or better in some other way), generally one can invest time and money in improving the software, improving the hardware, or both. There are various approaches with advantages and disadvantages in terms of decreased latency, increased throughput and reduced energy consumption. Typical advantages of focusing on software may include more rapid development, lower non-recurring engineering costs, heightened portability, and ease of updating features or patching bugs, at the cost of overhead to compute general operations. Advantages of focusing on hardware may include speedup, reduced power consumption, lower latency, increased parallelism and bandwidth, and better utilization of area and functional components available on an integrated circuit; at the cost of lower ability to update designs once etched onto silicon and higher costs of functional verification, and times to market. In the hierarchy of digital computing systems ranging from general-purpose processors to fully customized hardware, there is a tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency, with efficiency increasing by orders of magnitude when any given application is implemented higher up that hierarchy. This hierarchy includes general-purpose processors such as CPUs, more specialized processors such as GPUs, fixed-function implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and fixed-function implemented on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).\nHardware acceleration is advantageous for performance, and practical when the functions are fixed so updates are not as needed as in software solutions. With the advent of reprogrammable logic devices such as FPGAs, the restriction of hardware acceleration to fully fixed algorithms has eased since 2010, allowing hardware acceleration to be applied to problem domains requiring modification to algorithms and processing control flow.[10] The disadvantage however, is that in many open source projects, it requires proprietary libraries that not all vendors are keen to distribute or expose, making it difficult to integrate in such projects."],"chatgpt_answers":["Hardware acceleration refers to the use of computer hardware, specifically hardware designed to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU).

Similarly, occasional dropping of some frames in a video application can go undetected due to perceptual limitations of humans. Approximate computing is based on the observation that in many scenarios, although performing exact computation requires large amount of resources, allowing bounded approximation can provide disproportionate gains in performance and energy, while still achieving acceptable result accuracy.[clarification needed]  For example, in k-means clustering algorithm, allowing only 5% loss in classification accuracy can provide 50 times energy saving compared to the fully accurate classification.\nThe key requirement in approximate computing is that approximation can be introduced only in non-critical data, since approximating critical data (e.g., control operations) can lead to disastrous consequences, such as program crash or erroneous output."],"chatgpt_answers":["Approximate computing is a computing paradigm that involves intentionally introducing errors or uncertainty into computing systems in order to reduce resource consumption or improve performance.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Bounded rationality\"","human_answers":["Bounded rationality is the idea that rationality is limited when individuals make decisions, and under these limitations, rational individuals will select a decision that is satisfactory rather than optimal.\nLimitations include the difficulty of the problem requiring a decision, the cognitive capability of the mind, and the time available to make the decision. Decision-makers, in this view, act as satisficers, seeking a satisfactory solution, with everything that they have at the moment rather than an optimal solution. Therefore, humans do not undertake a full cost-benefit analysis to determine the optimal decision, but rather, choose an option that fulfils their adequacy criteria. An example of this being within organisations when they must adhere to the operating conditions of their company, this has the opportunity to result in bounded rationality as the organisation is not able to choose the optimal option.\nSome models of human behavior in the social sciences assume that humans can be reasonably approximated or described as \"rational\" entities, as in rational choice theory or Downs' political agency model. The concept of bounded rationality complements \"rationality as optimization\", which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available. Therefore, bounded rationality can be said to address the discrepancy between the assumed perfect rationality of human behaviour (which is utilised by other economics theories such as the Neoclassical approach), and the reality of human cognition.  In short, bounded rationality revises notions of \"perfect\" rationality to account for the fact that perfectly rational decisions are often not feasible in practice because of the intractability of natural decision problems and the finite computational resources available for making them. The concept of bounded rationality continues to influence (and be debated in) different disciplines, including political science, economics, psychology, law and cognitive science."],"chatgpt_answers":["Bounded rationality is a concept in behavioral economics and decision-making that suggests that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the cognitive and emotional constraints of their minds.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Multi-armed bandit\"","human_answers":["In probability theory and machine learning, the multi-armed bandit problem (sometimes called the K- or N-armed bandit problem) is a problem in which a fixed limited set of resources must be allocated between competing (alternative) choices in a way that maximizes their expected gain, when each choice's properties are only partially known at the time of allocation, and may become better understood as time passes or by allocating resources to the choice. This is a classic reinforcement learning problem that exemplifies the exploration\u2013exploitation tradeoff dilemma. The name comes from imagining a gambler at a row of slot machines (sometimes known as \"one-armed bandits\"), who has to decide which machines to play, how many times to play each machine and in which order to play them, and whether to continue with the current machine or try a different machine.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Monte Carlo sampling\"","human_answers":["Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.\nIn physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures (see cellular Potts model, interacting particle systems, McKean\u2013Vlasov processes, kinetic models of gases).\nOther examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business and, in mathematics, evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals with complicated boundary conditions. In application to systems engineering problems (space, oil exploration, aircraft design, etc.), Monte Carlo\u2013based predictions of failure, cost overruns and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative \"soft\" methods.\nIn principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean (a.k.a. the 'sample mean') of independent samples of the variable. When the probability distribution of the variable is parameterized, mathematicians often use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The central idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a prescribed stationary probability distribution. That is, in the limit, the samples being generated by the MCMC method will be samples from the desired (target) distribution. By the ergodic theorem, the stationary distribution is approximated by the empirical measures of the random states of the MCMC sampler.\nIn other problems, the objective is generating draws from a sequence of probability distributions satisfying a nonlinear evolution equation. These flows of probability distributions can always be interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov process whose transition probabilities depend on the distributions of the current random states (see McKean\u2013Vlasov processes, nonlinear filtering equation). In other instances we are given a flow of probability distributions with an increasing level of sampling complexity (path spaces models with an increasing time horizon, Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs measures associated with decreasing temperature parameters, and many others). These models can also be seen as the evolution of the law of the random states of a nonlinear Markov chain.[10] A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear Markov processes is to sample multiple copies of the process, replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the random states by the sampled empirical measures. In contrast with traditional Monte Carlo and MCMC methodologies, these mean-field particle techniques rely on sequential interacting samples. The terminology mean field reflects the fact that each of the samples (a.k.a. particles, individuals, walkers, agents, creatures, or phenotypes) interacts with the empirical measures of the process. When the size of the system tends to infinity, these random empirical measures converge to the deterministic distribution of the random states of the nonlinear Markov chain, so that the statistical interaction between particles vanishes.\nDespite its conceptual and algorithmic simplicity, the computational cost associated with a Monte Carlo simulation can be staggeringly high. In general the method requires many samples to get a good approximation, which may incur an arbitrarily large total runtime if the processing time of a single sample is high.[11] Although this is a severe limitation in very complex problems, the embarrassingly parallel nature of the algorithm allows this large cost to be reduced (perhaps to a feasible level) through parallel computing strategies in local processors, clusters, cloud computing, GPU, FPGA, etc.[12][13][14][15]"],"chatgpt_answers":["Monte Carlo sampling is a technique used in computer simulations to generate random samples from a multivariate distribution.

This process is repeated multiple times to generate a large number of samples, which can then be used to estimate various statistical properties of the distribution, such as the mean, variance, and distribution of the samples.\n\n\n\nMonte Carlo sampling is often used in statistical modeling, machine learning, and other fields where the goal is to estimate some quantity based on random samples from a complex distribution.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Lazy evaluation\"","human_answers":["In programming language theory, lazy evaluation, or call-by-need, is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed (non-strict evaluation) and which also avoids repeated evaluations (sharing).\nThe benefits of lazy evaluation include: \nLazy evaluation is often combined with memoization, as described in Jon Bentley's Writing Efficient Programs. After a function's value is computed for that parameter or set of parameters, the result is stored in a lookup table that is indexed by the values of those parameters; the next time the function is called, the table is consulted to determine whether the result for that combination of parameter values is already available. If so, the stored result is simply returned. If not, the function is evaluated and another entry is added to the lookup table for reuse.\nLazy evaluation is difficult to combine with imperative features such as exception handling and input\/output, because the order of operations becomes indeterminate. \nThe opposite of lazy evaluation is eager evaluation, sometimes known as strict evaluation. Eager evaluation is the evaluation strategy employed in most[quantify] programming languages."],"chatgpt_answers":["Lazy evaluation is a strategy used in computer programming to delay the evaluation of an expression until its value is actually needed. This approach is often used to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary computations, and it can also be used to facilitate the creation of infinite data structures.\n\n\n\nIn many programming languages, expressions are evaluated as soon as they are encountered during the execution of a program. However, with lazy evaluation, the evaluation of an expression is delayed until it is actually required. This can be accomplished through the use of special constructs, such as lazy variables or lazy functions, which are evaluated only when they are accessed or called.\n\n\n\nOne common use of lazy evaluation is to improve the performance of a program by avoiding the computation of unnecessary values. For example, if a program needs to perform a computation that involves a large data set, it may be more efficient to use lazy evaluation to compute only the values that are actually needed, rather than computing the entire data set and then discarding the unused values.\n\n\n\nLazy evaluation can also be used to create infinite data structures, such as streams or lists that can be traversed indefinitely.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Electromagnetic radiation\"","human_answers":["In physics, electromagnetic radiation (EMR) consists of waves of the electromagnetic (EM) field, which propagate through space and carry momentum and electromagnetic radiant energy. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, (visible) light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. All of these waves form part of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nClassically, electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields.  Depending on the frequency of oscillation, different wavelengths of electromagnetic spectrum are produced. In a vacuum, electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, commonly denoted c. In homogeneous, isotropic media, the oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave. The position of an electromagnetic wave within the electromagnetic spectrum can be characterized by either its frequency of oscillation or its wavelength.  Electromagnetic waves of different frequency are called by different names since they have different sources and effects on matter.  In order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength these are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.\nElectromagnetic waves are emitted by electrically charged particles undergoing acceleration, and these waves can subsequently interact with other charged particles, exerting force on them.  EM waves carry energy, momentum and angular momentum away from their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which they interact.  Electromagnetic radiation is associated with those EM waves that are free to propagate themselves (\"radiate\") without the continuing influence of the moving charges that produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the far field. In this language, the near field refers to EM fields near the charges and current that directly produced them, specifically electromagnetic induction and electrostatic induction phenomena.\nIn quantum mechanics, an alternate way of viewing EMR is that it consists of photons, uncharged elementary particles with zero rest mass which are the quanta of the electromagnetic field, responsible for all electromagnetic interactions. Quantum electrodynamics is the theory of how EMR interacts with matter on an atomic level. Quantum effects provide additional sources of EMR, such as the transition of electrons to lower energy levels in an atom and black-body radiation. The energy of an individual photon is quantized and is greater for photons of higher frequency. This relationship is given by Planck's equation E = hf, where E is the energy per photon, f is the frequency of the photon, and h is Planck's constant. A single gamma ray photon, for example, might carry ~100,000 times the energy of a single photon of visible light.\nThe effects of EMR upon chemical compounds and biological organisms depend both upon the radiation's power and its frequency. EMR of visible or lower frequencies (i.e., visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves) is called non-ionizing radiation, because its photons do not individually have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules, or break chemical bonds. The effects of these radiations on chemical systems and living tissue are caused primarily by heating effects from the combined energy transfer of many photons. In contrast, high frequency ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays are called ionizing radiation, since individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to ionize molecules or break chemical bonds. These radiations have the ability to cause chemical reactions and damage living cells beyond that resulting from simple heating, and can be a health hazard."],"chatgpt_answers":["Electromagnetic radiation is a type of energy that is emitted by electrically charged particles and travels through the air or through space in the form of electromagnetic waves.

Slightly more than half of the energy from the Sun was eventually found, through Herschel's studies, to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared. The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has an important effect on Earth's climate.\nInfrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when changing rotational-vibrational movements. It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment, making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Hyperspectral imager\"","human_answers":["Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. The goal of hyperspectral imaging is to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene, with the purpose of finding objects, identifying materials, or detecting processes. There are three general branches of spectral imagers. There are push broom scanners and the related whisk broom scanners (spatial scanning), which read images over time, band sequential scanners (spectral scanning), which acquire images of an area at different wavelengths, and snapshot hyperspectral imaging, which uses a staring array to generate an image in an instant.\nWhereas the human eye sees color of visible light in mostly three bands (long wavelengths - perceived as red, medium wavelengths - perceived as green, and short wavelengths - perceived as blue), spectral imaging divides the spectrum into many more bands. This technique of dividing images into bands can be extended beyond the visible. In hyperspectral imaging, the recorded spectra have fine wavelength resolution and cover a wide range of wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging measures continuous spectral bands, as opposed to multiband imaging which measures spaced spectral bands.\nEngineers build hyperspectral sensors and processing systems for applications in astronomy, agriculture, molecular biology, biomedical imaging, geosciences, physics, and surveillance. Hyperspectral sensors look at objects using a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Certain objects leave unique 'fingerprints' in the electromagnetic spectrum. Known as spectral signatures, these 'fingerprints' enable identification of the materials that make up a scanned object.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Radar imaging\"","human_answers":["Imaging radar is an application of radar which is used to create two-dimensional images, typically of landscapes. Imaging radar provides its light to illuminate an area on the ground and take a picture at radio wavelengths. It uses an antenna and digital computer storage to record its images. In a radar image, one can see only the energy that was reflected back towards the radar antenna. The radar moves along a flight path and the area illuminated by the radar, or footprint, is moved along the surface in a swath, building the image as it does so.\nDigital radar images are composed of many dots.  Each pixel in the radar image represents the radar backscatter for that area on the ground: brighter areas represent high backscatter, darker areas represents low backscatter.\nThe traditional application of radar is to display the position and motion of typically highly reflective objects (such as aircraft or ships) by sending out a radiowave signal, and then detecting the direction and delay of the reflected signal. Imaging radar on the other hand attempts to form an image of one object (e.g. a landscape) by furthermore registering the intensity of the reflected signal to determine the amount of scattering (cf. Light scattering). The registered electromagnetic scattering is then mapped onto a two-dimensional plane, with points with a higher reflectivity getting assigned usually a brighter color, thus creating an image.\nSeveral techniques have evolved to do this. Generally they take advantage of the Doppler effect caused by the rotation or other motion of the object and by the changing view of the object brought about by the relative motion between the object and the back-scatter that is perceived by the radar of the object (typically, a plane) flying over the earth. Through recent improvements of the techniques, radar imaging is getting more accurate.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Magnetic resonance image\"","human_answers":["Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body. MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields, magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to generate images of the organs in the body. MRI does not involve X-rays or the use of ionizing radiation, which distinguishes it from CT and PET scans. MRI is a medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which can also be used for imaging in other NMR applications, such as NMR spectroscopy.\nMRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis, staging and follow-up of disease. Compared to CT, MRI provides better contrast in images of soft-tissues, e.g. in the brain or abdomen. However, it may be perceived as less comfortable by patients, due to the usually longer and louder measurements with the subject in a long, confining tube, though \"Open\" MRI designs mostly relieve this. Additionally, implants and other non-removable metal in the body can pose a risk and may exclude some patients from undergoing an MRI examination safely.\nMRI was originally called NMRI (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging), but \"nuclear\" was dropped to avoid negative associations. Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb radio frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field; the resultant evolving spin polarization can induce a RF signal in a radio frequency coil and thereby be detected. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a macroscopic polarization that is detected by antennas close to the subject being examined. Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in humans and other biological organisms, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition, and magnetic field gradients localize the polarization in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.\nSince its development in the 1970s and 1980s, MRI has proven to be a versatile imaging technique. While MRI is most prominently used in diagnostic medicine and biomedical research, it also may be used to form images of non-living objects, such as mummies. Diffusion MRI and functional MRI extend the utility of MRI to capture neuronal tracts and blood flow respectively in the nervous system, in addition to detailed spatial images.

Several modelling approaches have been designed to surmount this problem, such as applying the Markov assumption or using neural architectures such as recurrent neural networks or transformers.\nLanguage models are useful for a variety of problems in computational linguistics; from initial applications in speech recognition to ensure nonsensical (i.e. low-probability) word sequences are not predicted, to wider use in machine translation (e.g. scoring candidate translations), natural language generation (generating more human-like text), part-of-speech tagging, parsing, Optical Character Recognition, handwriting recognition, grammar induction, information retrieval, and other applications.\nLanguage models are used in information retrieval in the query likelihood model.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Association rule mining\"","human_answers":["Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness. In any given transaction with a variety of items, association rules are meant to discover the rules that determine how or why certain items are connected.\nBased on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule \n\n\n\n{\n\no\nn\ni\no\nn\ns\n,\np\no\nt\na\nt\no\ne\ns\n\n}\n\u21d2\n{\n\nb\nu\nr\ng\ne\nr\n\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \\}\\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm {burger} \\}}\n\n found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements.\nIn addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\nThe association rule algorithm itself consists of various parameters that can make it difficult for those without some expertise in data mining to execute, with many rules that are arduous to understand."],"chatgpt_answers":["Association rule mining is a technique used in data mining to discover relationships between variables in large datasets. It is used to identify patterns in data that can be used to predict the occurrence of certain events or to inform decision-making.\n\n\n\nAssociation rules are typically represented in the form of \"if-then\" statements, where the \"if\" part of the statement represents a set of items (or \"itemsets\") that co-occur in a transaction, and the \"then\" part represents an item (or \"itemset\") that is likely to be purchased with the items in the \"if\" part. For example, an association rule might be \"if a customer buys bread and milk, then they are likely to also buy butter.\"\n\n\n\nTo identify association rules, data mining algorithms typically use a measure of the strength of the association between the items in the \"if\" and \"then\" parts of the rule. This measure is called support, and it reflects the number of transactions in the dataset in which the items co-occur. A rule with high support is considered to be more reliable, because it occurs more frequently in the data.\n\n\n\nAssociation rule mining can be used in a variety of applications, including market basket analysis, fraud detection, and recommendation systems.

Some spatial databases handle more complex structures such as 3D objects, topological coverages, linear networks, and triangulated irregular networks (TINs). While typical databases have developed to manage various numeric and character types of data, such databases require additional functionality to process spatial data types efficiently, and developers have often added geometry or feature data types. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) developed the Simple Features specification (first released in 1997) and sets standards for adding spatial functionality to database systems.

Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\nWhen data are unlabelled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups.

The data mart is a subset of the data warehouse and is usually oriented to a specific business line or team. Whereas data warehouses have an enterprise-wide depth, the information in data marts pertains to a single department. In some deployments, each department or business unit is considered the owner of its data mart including all the hardware, software and data.  This enables each department to isolate the use, manipulation and development of their data. In other deployments where conformed dimensions are used, this business unit owner will not hold true for shared dimensions like customer, product, etc.\nWarehouses and data marts are built because the information in the database is not organized in a way that makes it readily accessible. This organization requires queries that are too complicated, difficult to access or resource intensive.\nWhile transactional databases are designed to be updated, data warehouses or marts are read only. Data warehouses are designed to access large groups of related records.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Edward Snowden\"","human_answers":["Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American and naturalized Russian former computer intelligence consultant who leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013, when he was an employee and subcontractor. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy.\nIn 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved, and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Barton Gellman, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian, The Washington Post, and other publications. Snowden also made extensive allegations against the GCSB, blowing the whistle of their domestic surveillance of New Zealanders and acts of espionage under John Key's government.\nOn June 21, 2013, the United States Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property, following which the Department of State revoked his passport. Two days later, he flew into Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, where Russian authorities observed the canceled passport, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia later granted Snowden the right of asylum with an initial visa for residence for one year, which was subsequently repeatedly extended. In October 2020, he was granted permanent residency in Russia. In September 2022, Snowden was granted Russian citizenship by President Vladimir Putin,[10] and on 2 December 2022 he swore the oath of allegiance.[11]\nA subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a traitor,[12] a hero,[13] a whistleblower,[14] a dissident,[15] a coward,[16] and a patriot.[17] U.S. officials condemned his actions as having done \"grave damage\" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities.[18] Snowden has defended his leaks as an effort \"to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.\"[19] His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information privacy, something that he has said he intended to do in retrospective interviews.[20]\nIn early 2016, Snowden became the president of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a San Francisco\u2013based nonprofit organization that aims to protect journalists from hacking and government surveillance.[21] He also has a job at an unnamed Russian IT company.[22] In 2017, he married Lindsay Mills. \"I have to lay my head down in Moscow on a pillow at night,\" he told an Israeli audience in November 2018, \"but I live on the internet and every other city in the world.\"[23] On September 17, 2019, his memoir Permanent Record was published.[24] On September 2, 2020, a U.S. federal court ruled in United States v.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Global surveillance disclosure\"","human_answers":["Ongoing news reports in the international media have revealed operational details about the Anglophone cryptographic agencies' global surveillance of both foreign and domestic nationals. The reports mostly emanate from a cache of top secret documents leaked by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden, which he obtained whilst working for Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the largest contractors for defense and intelligence in the United States. In addition to a trove of U.S. federal documents, Snowden's cache reportedly contains thousands of Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand intelligence files that he had accessed via the exclusive \"Five Eyes\" network. In June 2013, the first of Snowden's documents were published simultaneously by The Washington Post and The Guardian, attracting considerable public attention. The disclosure continued throughout 2013, and a small portion of the estimated full cache of documents was later published by other media outlets worldwide, most notably The New York Times (United States), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Der Spiegel (Germany), O Globo (Brazil), Le Monde (France), L'espresso (Italy), NRC Handelsblad (the Netherlands), Dagbladet (Norway), El Pa\u00eds (Spain), and Sveriges Television (Sweden).\nThese media reports have shed light on the implications of several secret treaties signed by members of the UKUSA community in their efforts to implement global surveillance. For example, Der Spiegel revealed how the German Federal Intelligence Service (German: Bundesnachrichtendienst; BND) transfers \"massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA\", while Swedish Television revealed the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) provided the NSA with data from its cable collection, under a secret treaty signed in 1954 for bilateral cooperation on surveillance. Other security and intelligence agencies involved in the practice of global surveillance include those in Australia (ASD), Britain (GCHQ), Canada (CSE), Denmark (PET), France (DGSE), Germany (BND), Italy (AISE), the Netherlands (AIVD), Norway (NIS), Spain (CNI), Switzerland (NDB), Singapore (SID) as well as Israel (ISNU), which receives raw, unfiltered data of U.S. citizens that is shared by the NSA.[10][11][12][13][14][15]\nOn June 14, 2013, United States prosecutors charged Edward Snowden with espionage and theft of government property. In late July 2013, he was granted a one-year temporary asylum by the Russian government,[16] contributing to a deterioration of Russia\u2013United States relations.[17][18] Towards the end of October 2013, the British Prime Minister David Cameron warned The Guardian not to publish any more leaks, or it will receive a DA-Notice.[19] In November 2013, a criminal investigation of the disclosure was being undertaken by Britain's Metropolitan Police Service.[20] In December 2013, The Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said: \"We have published I think 26 documents so far out of the 58,000 we've seen.\"[21]\nThe extent to which the media reports have responsibly informed the public is disputed. In January 2014, Obama said that \"the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light\"[22] and critics such as Sean Wilentz have noted that many of the Snowden documents released do not concern domestic surveillance.[23] The US & British Defense establishment weigh the strategic harm in the period following the disclosures more heavily than their civic public benefit. In its first assessment of these disclosures, the Pentagon concluded that Snowden committed the biggest \"theft\" of U.S. secrets in the history of the United States.[24] Sir David Omand, a former director of GCHQ, described Snowden's disclosure as the \"most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever\".[25]"],"chatgpt_answers":["Global surveillance refers to the practice of governments and other organizations around the world collecting and analyzing information about individuals, groups, and nations for various purposes.

It is bicameral, composed of a lower body, the House of Representatives, and an upper body, the Senate. It meets in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governor's appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The U.S. vice president has a vote in the Senate only when senators are evenly divided. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members.\nThe sitting of a Congress is for a two-year term, at present, beginning every other January. Elections are held every even-numbered year on Election Day. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 establishes that there be 435 representatives and the Uniform Congressional Redistricting Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the Congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one Congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states.\nArticle One of the U.S. Constitution requires that members of Congress must be at least 25 years old (House) or at least 30 years old (Senate), have been a citizen of the U.S. for seven (House) or nine (Senate) years, and be an inhabitant of the state which they represent. Members in both chambers may stand for re-election an unlimited number of times.\nThe Congress was created by the U.S. Constitution and first met in 1789, replacing the Congress of the Confederation in its legislative function. Although not legally mandated, in practice since the 19th century, Congress members are typically affiliated with one of the two major parties, the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, and only rarely with a third party or independents affiliated with no party.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Web mining\"","human_answers":["Data mining is the process of extracting and discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the \"knowledge discovery in databases\" process, or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating.\nThe term \"data mining\" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (mining) of data itself. It also is a buzzword and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics\u2014or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning\u2014are more appropriate.\nThe actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records (cluster analysis), unusual records (anomaly detection), and dependencies (association rule mining, sequential pattern mining). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.\nThe difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign, regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data.[10]\nThe related terms data dredging, data fishing, and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Intellectual property\"","human_answers":["Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. There are many types of intellectual property, and some countries recognize more than others. The best-known types are patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. The modern concept of intellectual property developed in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. The term \"intellectual property\" began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the world's legal systems.\nThe main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods. To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time. This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to benefit from the information and intellectual goods they create, and allows them to protect their ideas and prevent copying. These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.[10]\nThe intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods. Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is \"indivisible\", since an unlimited number of people can \"consume\" an intellectual good without its being depleted.[11][page\u00a0needed] Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation: Landowners can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but producers of information or literature can usually do little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.[12]"],"chatgpt_answers":["Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, and images used in commerce.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Weak AI\"","human_answers":["Weak artificial intelligence (weak AI) is artificial intelligence that implements a limited part of mind, or, as narrow AI, is focused on one narrow task. In John Searle's terms it \u201cwould be useful for testing hypotheses about minds, but would not actually be minds\u201d. Weak artificial intelligence focuses on mimicking how humans perform basic actions such as remembering things, perceiving things, and solving simple problems.  As opposed to strong AI, which uses technology to be able to think and learn on its own. Computers are able to use methods such as algorithms and prior knowledge to develop their own ways of thinking like human beings do.  Strong artificial intelligence systems are learning how to run independently of the programmers who programmed them. Weak AI is not able to have a mind of its own, and can only imitate physical behaviors that it can observe. \nIt is contrasted with Strong AI, which is defined variously as: \nScholars like Antonio Lieto have argued that the current research on both AI and cognitive modelling are perfectly aligned with the weak-AI hypothesis (that should not be confused with the \"general\" vs \"narrow\" AI distinction) and that the popular assumption that cognitively inspired AI systems espouse the strong AI hypothesis is ill-posed and problematic since \"artificial models of brain and mind can be used to understand mental phenomena without pretending that that they are the real phenomena that they are modelling\"  (p. 85) (as, on the other hand, implied by the strong AI assumption).\nAI can be classified as being \u201c\u2026 limited to a single, narrowly defined task. Most modern AI systems would be classified in this category.\u201d  Narrow means the robot or computer is strictly limited to only being able to solve one problem at a time. Strong AI is conversely the opposite. Strong AI is as close to the human brain or mind as possible. This is all believed to be the case by philosopher John Searle. This idea of strong AI is also controversial, and Searle believes that the Turing test (created by Alan Turing during WW2, originally called the Imitation Game, used to test if a machine is as intelligent as a human) is not accurate or appropriate for testing strong AI.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Computational intelligence\"","human_answers":["The expression computational intelligence (CI) usually refers to the ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation. Even though it is commonly considered a synonym of soft computing, there is still no commonly accepted definition of computational intelligence.\nGenerally, computational intelligence is a set of nature-inspired computational methodologies and approaches to address complex real-world problems to which mathematical or traditional modelling can be useless for a few reasons: the processes might be too complex for mathematical reasoning, it might contain some uncertainties during the process, or the process might simply be stochastic in nature.[page\u00a0needed] Indeed, many real-life problems cannot be translated into binary language (unique values of 0 and 1) for computers to process it. Computational Intelligence therefore provides solutions for such problems.\nThe methods used are close to the human's way of reasoning, i.e. it uses inexact and incomplete knowledge, and it is able to produce control actions in an adaptive way. CI therefore uses a combination of five main complementary techniques. The fuzzy logic which enables the computer to understand natural language,[page\u00a0needed] artificial neural networks which permits the system to learn experiential data by operating like the biological one, evolutionary computing, which is based on the process of natural selection, learning theory, and probabilistic methods which helps dealing with uncertainty imprecision.\nExcept those main principles, currently popular approaches include biologically inspired algorithms such as swarm intelligence and artificial immune systems, which can be seen as a part of evolutionary computation, image processing, data mining, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence, which tends to be confused with Computational Intelligence. But although both Computational Intelligence (CI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) seek similar goals, there's a clear distinction between them[according to whom?][citation needed].\nComputational Intelligence is thus a way of performing like human beings[citation needed].

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Self-determination theory\"","human_answers":["Self-determination theory (SDT) is a macro theory of human motivation and personality that concerns people's innate growth tendencies and innate psychological needs. It pertains to the motivation behind people's choices in the absence of external influences and distractions. SDT focuses on the degree to which human behavior is self-motivated and self-determined.\nIn the 1970s, research on SDT evolved from studies comparing intrinsic and extrinsic motives, and from growing understanding of the dominant role that intrinsic motivation played in individual behavior. It was not until the mid-1980s Edward L. Deci and Richard Ryan wrote a book titled \"Self-Determination and Intrinsic Motivation in Human Behavior\" that SDT was formally introduced and accepted as a sound empirical theory. Since the 2000s, research into practical applications of SDT has increased significantly.\nThe key research that led to the emergence of SDT included research on intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation refers to initiating an activity because it is interesting and satisfying in itself to do so, as opposed to doing an activity for the purpose of obtaining an external goal (extrinsic motivation). A taxonomy of motivations has been described based on the degree to which they are internalized. Internalization refers to the active attempt to transform an extrinsic motive into personally endorsed values and thus assimilate behavioral regulations that were originally external.\nEdward Deci and Richard Ryan later expanded on the early work differentiating between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and proposed three main intrinsic needs involved in self-determination.[10] According to Deci and Ryan, three basic psychological needs motivate self-initiated behavior and specify essential nutrients for individual psychological health and well-being. These needs are said to be the universal and innate need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness."],"chatgpt_answers":["Self-determination theory (SDT) is a theory of human motivation and personality that explains how people's basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are related to their well-being and psychological health.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Mind\u2013body dualism\"","human_answers":["In the philosophy of mind, mind\u2013body dualism denotes either the view that mental phenomena are non-physical, or that the mind and body are distinct and separable. Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, as well as between subject and object, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism and enactivism, in the mind\u2013body problem.\nAristotle shared Plato's view of multiple souls and further elaborated a hierarchical arrangement, corresponding to the distinctive functions of plants, animals, and humans: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure, and desire that only humans and other animals share; and the faculty of reason that is unique to humans only. In this view, a soul is the hylomorphic form of a viable organism, wherein each level of the hierarchy formally supervenes upon the substance of the preceding level. For Aristotle, the first two souls, based on the body, perish when the living organism dies, whereas remains an immortal and perpetual intellective part of mind. For Plato, however, the soul was not dependent on the physical body; he believed in metempsychosis, the migration of the soul to a new physical body. It has been considered a form of reductionism by some philosophers, since it enables the tendency to ignore very big groups of variables by its assumed association with the mind or the body, and not for its real value when it comes to explaining or predicting a studied phenomenon.\nDualism is closely associated with the thought of Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1641), which holds that the mind is a nonphysical\u2014and therefore, non-spatial\u2014substance. Descartes clearly identified the mind with consciousness and self-awareness and distinguished this from the brain as the seat of intelligence. Hence, he was the first documented Western philosopher to formulate the mind\u2013body problem in the form in which it exists today. Dualism is contrasted with various kinds of monism.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Brute-force attack\"","human_answers":["In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function. This is known as an exhaustive key search.\nA brute-force attack is a cryptanalytic attack that can, in theory, be used to attempt to decrypt any encrypted data (except for data encrypted in an information-theoretically secure manner).  Such an attack might be used when it is not possible to take advantage of other weaknesses in an encryption system (if any exist) that would make the task easier.\nWhen password-guessing, this method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used because a brute-force search takes too long. Longer passwords, passphrases and keys have more possible values, making them exponentially more difficult to crack than shorter ones.\nBrute-force attacks can be made less effective by obfuscating the data to be encoded making it more difficult for an attacker to recognize when the code has been cracked or by making the attacker do more work to test each guess.

It refers to the difficulty of ensuring that the symbols used by a system, such as a computer program or a robot, have a clear and consistent meaning that can be understood and interpreted by the system and by humans.\n\n\n\nOne way to understand the symbol grounding problem is to consider the use of language by humans. When we communicate using language, we rely on a shared understanding of the meanings of words and symbols. For example, when I say the word \"dog,\" you know that I am referring to a specific type of animal because we have a shared understanding of what the word \"dog\" means. This shared understanding is grounded in our shared experiences and our physical and social environment.\n\n\n\nIn the case of artificial systems, the problem of symbol grounding arises because these systems do not have the same kind of shared experiences and physical and social environment as humans. As a result, it can be difficult to ensure that the symbols used by the system have a clear and consistent meaning. For example, if a computer program is designed to recognize and classify objects in an image, it may be difficult to ensure that the program understands the meanings of the words \"dog\" and \"cat\" in the same way that humans do.\n\n\n\nTo solve the symbol grounding problem, researchers have proposed a number of different approaches, including the use of machine learning techniques, the integration of sensory and perceptual information, and the development of more sophisticated symbol systems that can better capture the complexity of human language and thought."]}

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Whole brain emulation\"","human_answers":["Mind uploading is a speculative process of whole brain emulation in which a brain scan is used to completely emulate the mental state of the individual in a digital computer. The computer would then run a simulation of the brain's information processing, such that it would respond in essentially the same way as the original brain and experience having a sentient conscious mind.\nSubstantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in animal brain mapping and simulation, development of faster supercomputers, virtual reality, brain\u2013computer interfaces, connectomics, and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains.  According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are currently under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but say they are still in the realm of engineering possibility.\nMind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods: copy-and-upload or copy-and-delete by gradual replacement of neurons (which can be considered as a gradual destructive uploading), until the original organic brain no longer exists and a computer program emulating the brain takes control over the body. In the case of the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by storing and copying, that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The biological brain may not survive the copying process or may be deliberately destroyed during it in some variants of uploading. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could reside in a computer inside (or either connected to or remotely controlled) a (not necessarily humanoid) robot or a biological or cybernetic body.\nAmong some futurists and within the part of transhumanist movement, mind uploading is treated as an important proposed life extension or immortality technology (known as \"digital immortality\"). Some believe mind uploading is humanity's current best option for preserving the identity of the species, as opposed to cryonics. Another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup to our \"mind-file\", to enable interstellar space travel, and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a computing device. Whole-brain emulation is discussed by some futurists as a \"logical endpoint\" of the topical computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields, both about brain simulation for medical research purposes. It is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications as an approach to strong AI (artificial general intelligence) and to at least weak superintelligence. Another approach is seed AI, which would not be based on existing brains. Computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Cerebral cortex\"","human_answers":["The cerebral cortex, also known as the cerebral mantle, is the outer layer of neural tissue of the cerebrum of the brain in humans and other mammals. The cerebral cortex mostly consists of the six-layered neocortex, with just 10% consisting of allocortex. It is separated into two cortices, by the longitudinal fissure that divides the cerebrum into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The two hemispheres are joined beneath the cortex by the corpus callosum. The cerebral cortex is the largest site of neural integration in the central nervous system. It plays a key role in attention, perception, awareness, thought, memory, language, and consciousness. The cerebral cortex is part of the brain responsible for cognition.\nIn most mammals, apart from small mammals that have small brains, the cerebral cortex is folded, providing a greater surface area in the confined volume of the cranium. Apart from minimising brain and cranial volume, cortical folding is crucial for the brain circuitry and its functional organisation. In mammals with small brains there is no folding and the cortex is smooth.\nA fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus (plural gyri) and a groove is termed a sulcus (plural sulci). These surface convolutions appear during fetal development and continue to mature after birth through the process of gyrification. In the human brain the majority of the cerebral cortex is not visible from the outside, but buried in the sulci. The major sulci and gyri mark the divisions of the cerebrum into the lobes of the brain. The four major lobes are the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. Other lobes are the limbic lobe, and the insular cortex often referred to as the insular lobe.\nThere are between 14 and 16 billion neurons in the human cerebral cortex. These are organised into horizontal cortical layers, and radially into cortical columns and minicolumns. Cortical areas have specific functions such as movement in the motor cortex, and sight in the visual cortex. Visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe."],"chatgpt_answers":["The cerebral cortex is the outer layer of the cerebrum, which is the largest part of the brain.

Moravec wrote in 1988, \"it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility\".\nSimilarly, Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are below the level of conscious awareness. \"In general, we're least aware of what our minds do best\", he wrote, and added \"we're more aware of simple processes that don't work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly\".

In 2017, leading machine learning researcher Andrew Ng presented a \"highly imperfect rule of thumb\", that \"almost anything a typical human can do with less than one second of mental thought, we can probably now or in the near future automate using AI.\" There is currently no consensus as to which tasks AI tends to excel at."],"chatgpt_answers":["Moravec's paradox is a concept in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics that was proposed by Hans Moravec, a robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon University.

This is because tasks that are easy for humans often involve the use of common sense, pattern recognition, and other forms of high-level cognition, which are difficult to replicate in a machine.\n\n\n\nThe paradox highlights the fact that, while computers may be able to perform certain tasks faster and more accurately than humans, there are many tasks that are still challenging for them to perform.

Good's intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a \"runaway reaction\" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an \"explosion\" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.\nThe first person to use the concept of a \"singularity\" in the technological context was John von Neumann. Stanislaw Ulam reports a discussion with von Neumann \"centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue\". Subsequent authors have echoed this viewpoint.\nThe concept and the term \"singularity\" were popularized by Vernor Vinge first in 1983 in an article that claimed that once humans create intelligences greater than their own, there will be a technological and social transition similar in some sense to \"the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole\", and later in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he wrote that it would signal the end of the human era, as the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate. He wrote that he would be surprised if it occurred before 2005 or after 2030. Another significant contributor to wider circulation of the notion was Ray Kurzweil's 2005 book The Singularity is Near, predicting singularity by 2045.\nSome scientists, including Stephen Hawking, have expressed concern that artificial superintelligence (ASI) could result in human extinction.[10] The consequences of the singularity and its potential benefit or harm to the human race have been intensely debated.\nProminent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity and the associated artificial intelligence explosion, including Paul Allen,[11] Jeff Hawkins,[12] John Holland, Jaron Lanier, Steven Pinker,[12] Theodore Modis,[13] and Gordon Moore.[12] One claim made was that the artificial intelligence growth is likely to run into decreasing returns instead of accelerating ones, as was observed in previously developed human technologies."],"chatgpt_answers":["The technological singularity is a hypothetical future event that is associated with the creation of superintelligent artificial intelligence (AI).

Most mechanical calculators were comparable in size to small desktop computers and have been rendered obsolete by the advent of the electronic calculator and the digital computer.\nSurviving notes from Wilhelm Schickard in 1623 reveal that he designed and had built the earliest of the modern attempts at mechanizing calculation. His machine was composed of two sets of technologies: first an abacus made of Napier's bones, to simplify multiplications and divisions first described six years earlier in 1617, and for the mechanical part, it had a dialed pedometer to perform additions and subtractions.  A study of the surviving notes shows a machine that would have jammed after a few entries on the same dial, and that it could be damaged if a carry had to be propagated over a few digits (like adding 1 to 999). Schickard abandoned his project in 1624 and never mentioned it again until his death 11 years later in 1635.\nTwo decades after Schickard's supposedly failed attempt, in 1642, Blaise Pascal decisively solved these particular problems with his invention of the mechanical calculator. Co-opted into his father's labour as tax collector in Rouen, Pascal designed the calculator to help in the large amount of tedious arithmetic required; it was called Pascal's Calculator or Pascaline.\nThomas' arithmometer, the first commercially successful machine, was manufactured two hundred years later in 1851; it was the first mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. For forty years the arithmometer was the only type of mechanical calculator available for sale until the industrial production of the more successful Odhner Arithmometer in 1890.\nThe comptometer, introduced in 1887, was the first machine to use a keyboard that consisted of columns of nine keys (from 1 to 9) for each digit.

His philosophy also assimilates elements of the scholastic tradition, notably the assumption that some substantive knowledge of reality can be achieved by reasoning from first principles or prior definitions.

The process can also be used for patterned knitwear and machine-knitted textiles such as jerseys.[10]\nThis use of replaceable punched cards to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware, having inspired Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine."],"chatgpt_answers":["A Jacquard loom is a type of mechanical loom that is designed to automate the process of creating intricate patterns in textiles. It was invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in the early 19th century and is still used today in the production of fabrics such as brocade, damask, and tapestry.\n\n\n\nThe Jacquard loom works by using a series of punched cards, similar to those used in early computers, to control the movements of the loom's harnesses and needles. The cards are strung together in a sequence that corresponds to the desired pattern, and as the loom operates, the cards are read and the harnesses and needles are moved accordingly to create the pattern in the fabric.\n\n\n\nOne of the main advantages of the Jacquard loom is that it allows for the creation of complex, detailed patterns with a high level of precision and repeatability. It also allows for the creation of patterns that are difficult or impossible to achieve using traditional hand weaving techniques. As a result, Jacquard looms are often used in the production of high-quality, decorative fabrics."]}
{"question":"Please explain what is \"Ada Lovelace\"","human_answers":["Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (n\u00e9e Byron; 10 December 1815\u00a0\u2013 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.\nAda Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron. All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. Four months later, he commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, \"Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?\" He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\" and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".\nWhen she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as \"the father of computers\". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called \"Notes\". Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836\/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.[10] She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[11] Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool."],"chatgpt_answers":["Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer who is known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.

She was educated in mathematics and science, and became interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. In 1843, she translated an article about the engine written by an Italian mathematician, and added her own notes, which were more extensive than the original article.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Numerical analysis\"","human_answers":["Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis (as distinguished from discrete mathematics). It is the study of numerical methods that attempt at finding approximate solutions of problems rather than the exact ones. Numerical analysis finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, and in the 21st century also the life and social sciences, medicine, business and even the arts. Current growth in computing power has enabled the use of more complex numerical analysis, providing detailed and realistic mathematical models in science and engineering. Examples of numerical analysis include: ordinary differential equations as found in celestial mechanics (predicting the motions of planets, stars and galaxies), numerical linear algebra in data analysis, and stochastic differential equations and Markov chains for simulating living cells in medicine and biology.\nBefore modern computers, numerical methods often relied on hand interpolation formulas, using data from large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead, but many of the same formulas continue to be used in software algorithms.\nThe numerical point of view goes back to the earliest mathematical writings. A tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection (YBC 7289), gives a sexagesimal numerical approximation of the square root of 2, the length of the diagonal in a unit square.\nNumerical analysis continues this long tradition: rather than giving exact symbolic answers translated into digits and applicable only to real-world measurements, approximate solutions within specified error bounds are used."],"chatgpt_answers":["Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation (as opposed to symbolic manipulations) for the problems of mathematical analysis (as distinguished from discrete mathematics).

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Category theory\"","human_answers":["Category theory is a general theory of mathematical structures and their relations that was introduced by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane in the middle of the 20th century in their foundational work on algebraic topology. Nowadays, category theory is used in almost all areas of mathematics, and in some areas of computer science. In particular, many constructions of new mathematical objects from previous ones, that appear similarly in several contexts are conveniently expressed and unified in terms of categories. Examples include quotient spaces, direct products, completion, and duality.\nA category is formed by two sorts of objects: the objects of the category, and the morphisms, which relate two objects called the source and the target of the morphism. One often says that a morphism is an arrow that maps its source to its target. Morphisms can be composed if the target of the first morphism equals the source of the second one, and morphism composition has similar properties as function composition (associativity and existence of identity morphisms). Morphisms are often some sort of function, but this is not always the case. For example, a monoid may be viewed as a category with a single object, whose morphisms are the elements of the monoid.\nThe second fundamental concept of category is the concept of a functor, which plays the role of a morphism between two categories \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{1}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n2\n\n\n:\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{2}:}\n\n it maps objects of \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{1}}\n\n to objects of \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{2}}\n\n and morphisms of \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{1}}\n\n to morphisms of \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{2}}\n\n in such a way that sources are mapped to sources and targets are mapped to targets (or, in the case of a contravariant functor, sources are mapped to targets and vice-versa).

For example, in the category of groups, the objects are groups and the arrows are group homomorphisms. In the category of topological spaces, the objects are topological spaces and the arrows are continuous functions.\n\n\n\nThe main idea behind category theory is to study the relationships between these objects and the arrows that connect them, rather than the objects and arrows themselves.

Abstract domains are used to represent the computational complexity of algorithms and the approximation of real numbers, among other applications.\n\n\n\nIn domain theory, the partial order is often used to represent the relation \"less than or equal to,\" and the elements of the domain are typically interpreted as computational steps or approximations of real numbers. A fundamental concept in domain theory is that of a \"directed complete partial order,\" or dcpo, which is a partial order in which every subset has a least upper bound, or \"join.\"\n\n\n\nOne of the main goals of domain theory is to understand the relationship between the structure of an abstract domain and the computational complexity of algorithms that operate on it.

You could then use this ADT to create a function that takes a color as an argument and returns a different color based on some logic.\n\n\n\nADTs can also be used to define more complex data structures, such as trees or lists. For example, you might define an ADT called \"Tree\" that has two possible values: \"Leaf\" and \"Branch\". A \"Leaf\" value would represent a leaf node in a tree, while a \"Branch\" value would represent a branch node with one or more child nodes. You could then use this ADT to create functions that operate on trees, such as functions to traverse the tree or to search for a particular value.\n\n\n\nOverall, algebraic data types are a powerful tool for creating custom data types in functional programming languages, and they can be used to represent a wide range of data structures and values."]}

The statement being proved must include the assertion that the prover has such knowledge, but without including or transmitting the knowledge itself in the assertion. Otherwise, the statement would not be proved in zero-knowledge because it provides the verifier with additional information about the statement by the end of the protocol. A zero-knowledge proof of knowledge is a special case when the statement consists only of the fact that the prover possesses the secret information.\nInteractive zero-knowledge proofs require interaction between the individual (or computer system) proving their knowledge and the individual validating the proof.\nA protocol implementing zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge must necessarily require interactive input from the verifier. This interactive input is usually in the form of one or more challenges such that the responses from the prover will convince the verifier if and only if the statement is true, i.e., if the prover does possess the claimed knowledge. If this were not the case, the verifier could record the execution of the protocol and replay it to convince someone else that they possess the secret information. The new party's acceptance is either justified since the replayer does possess the information (which implies that the protocol leaked information, and thus, is not proved in zero-knowledge), or the acceptance is spurious, i.e., was accepted from someone who does not actually possess the information.\nSome forms of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs exist, but the validity of the proof relies on computational assumptions (typically the assumptions of an ideal cryptographic hash function)."],"chatgpt_answers":["Zero-knowledge proof, or zero-knowledge protocol, is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the fact that the statement is indeed true.\n\n\n\nIn other words, a zero-knowledge proof allows one party to prove to another party that they know the solution to a problem, without actually revealing the solution itself.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Video game\"","human_answers":["Video games,[a] also known as computer games, are electronic games that involves interaction with a user interface or input device \u2013 such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device \u2013 to generate visual feedback. This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, for example text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.\nVideo games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games. More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.\nThe first video game prototypes in the 1950s and 1960s were simple extensions of electronic games using video-like output from large room-size computers. The first consumer video game was the arcade video game Computer Space in 1971. In 1972 came the iconic hit arcade game Pong, and the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. The industry grew quickly during the golden age of arcade video games from the late 1970s to early 1980s, but suffered from the crash of the North American video game market in 1983 due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market. Following the crash, the industry matured, dominated by Japanese companies such as Nintendo, Sega, and Sony, and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future, many of which continue to be followed. Today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.\nIn the 2000s, the core industry centered on \"AAA\" games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent video game development (or indie games) to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Speech synthesis\"","human_answers":["Speech synthesis is the artificial production of human speech. A computer system used for this purpose is called a speech synthesizer, and can be implemented in software or hardware products. A text-to-speech (TTS) system converts normal language text into speech; other systems render symbolic linguistic representations like phonetic transcriptions into speech. The reverse process is speech recognition.\nSynthesized speech can be created by concatenating pieces of recorded speech that are stored in a database. Systems differ in the size of the stored speech units; a system that stores phones or diphones provides the largest output range, but may lack clarity. For specific usage domains, the storage of entire words or sentences allows for high-quality output. Alternatively, a synthesizer can incorporate a model of the vocal tract and other human voice characteristics to create a completely \"synthetic\" voice output.\nThe quality of a speech synthesizer is judged by its similarity to the human voice and by its ability to be understood clearly. An intelligible text-to-speech program allows people with visual impairments or reading disabilities to listen to written words on a home computer. Many computer operating systems have included speech synthesizers since the early 1990s.\nA text-to-speech system (or \"engine\") is composed of two parts: a front-end and a back-end. The front-end has two major tasks. First, it converts raw text containing symbols like numbers and abbreviations into the equivalent of written-out words. This process is often called text normalization, pre-processing, or tokenization. The front-end then assigns phonetic transcriptions to each word, and divides and marks the text into prosodic units, like phrases, clauses, and sentences. The process of assigning phonetic transcriptions to words is called text-to-phoneme or grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Phonetic transcriptions and prosody information together make up the symbolic linguistic representation that is output by the front-end. The back-end\u2014often referred to as the synthesizer\u2014then converts the symbolic linguistic representation into sound.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"Fast Fourier transform\"","human_answers":["A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies. This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by factorizing the DFT matrix into a product of sparse (mostly zero) factors. As a result, it manages to reduce the complexity of computing the DFT from \n\n\n\nO\n\n(\n\nN\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle O\\left(N^{2}\\right)}\n\n, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to \n\n\n\nO\n(\nN\nlog\n\u2061\nN\n)\n\n\n{\\textstyle O(N\\log N)}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nN\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N}\n\n is the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where N may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of round-off error, many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple complex-number arithmetic to group theory and number theory.\nFast Fourier transforms are widely used for applications in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805. In 1994, Gilbert Strang described the FFT as \"the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime\", and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the IEEE magazine Computing in Science & Engineering.\nThe best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the factorization of N, but there are FFTs with O(N\u00a0log\u00a0N) complexity for all N, even for prime\u00a0N.

Batches may automatically be run at scheduled times as well as being run contingent on the availability of computer resources."],"chatgpt_answers":["Batch processing is a method of running a series of programs or tasks in a computer, typically involving the use of a batch file or script, to process large amounts of data at once. It allows a user to perform a large number of tasks in a single operation, rather than running them one at a time.\n\n\n\nIn batch processing, a group of transactions or data is collected and processed at the same time, rather than processing each transaction or data individually. This can be more efficient because it allows the computer to process all of the transactions or data in a single run, rather than having to stop and start for each individual transaction or data item. Batch processing is often used for tasks that are time-consuming or require a lot of processing power, such as data mining, data analysis, and financial reporting.\n\n\n\nBatch processing is typically used in environments where data needs to be processed in large volumes, such as in businesses or scientific research. It is often used in conjunction with other types of processing, such as online processing or real-time processing, to provide a complete solution for handling data."]}
{"question":"Please explain what is \"Punched cards\"","human_answers":["A punched card (also punch card or punched-card) is a piece of stiff paper that holds digital data represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions. Punched cards were once common in data processing applications or to directly control automated machinery.\nPunched cards were widely used through much of the 20th century in the data processing industry, where specialized and increasingly complex unit record machines, organized into semiautomatic data processing systems, used punched cards for data input, output, and storage.  The IBM 12-row\/80-column punched card format came to dominate the industry. Many early digital computers used punched cards as the primary medium for input of both computer programs and data.\nWhile punched cards are now obsolete as a storage medium, as of 2012, some voting machines still used punched cards to record votes. They also had a significant cultural impact."],"chatgpt_answers":["Punched cards were a means of storing and processing data in early computers. They were made of cardboard or paper and had rows of holes punched into them in specific patterns to represent data. Each row of holes, or card, could store a small amount of information, such as a single record or a small program.\n\n\n\nPunched cards were used primarily in the 1950s and 1960s, before the development of more advanced storage technologies such as magnetic tapes and disks. To process data stored on punched cards, a computer would read the pattern of holes on each card and perform the appropriate calculations or instructions.\n\n\n\nPunched cards were commonly used in a wide range of applications, including scientific research, business data processing, and government record keeping. They were also used to program early computers, as the holes on the cards could be used to represent instructions in a machine-readable form.\n\n\n\nPunched cards are no longer used in modern computing, as they have been replaced by more efficient and convenient storage and processing technologies."]}
{"question":"Please explain what is \"Paper tape\"","human_answers":["Punched tape or perforated paper tape is a form of data storage that consists of a long strip of paper in which holes are punched. It developed from and was subsequently used alongside punched cards, differing in that the tape is continuous.\nPunched cards, and chains of punched cards, were used for control of looms in the 18th century. Use for telegraphy systems started in 1842. Punched tape was used throughout the 19th and for much of the 20th centuries for programmable looms, teleprinter communication, for input to computers of the 1950s and 1960s, and later as a storage medium for minicomputers and CNC machine tools. During the Second World War, high-speed punched tape systems using optical readout methods were used in code breaking systems. Punched tape was used to transmit data for manufacture of read-only memory chips."],"chatgpt_answers":["Paper tape is a medium for storing and transmitting data, consisting of a long strip of paper with holes punched into it in a specific pattern. It was used primarily in the mid-20th century for data entry and storage on computers, as well as for control functions in manufacturing and other industries.\n\n\n\nPaper tape was a common method of input for computers before the widespread use of keyboards. Data was entered onto the paper tape using a punch, which made holes in the tape according to a specific code. The punched tape could then be read by a machine, such as a computer or a loom, which would interpret the pattern of holes and carry out the corresponding actions.\n\n\n\nPaper tape had several advantages over other methods of data storage and transmission. It was relatively cheap, durable, and easy to use, and it could be easily edited by hand. However, it was also relatively slow and inflexible, and it has been largely replaced by other methods such as magnetic tapes and disks."]}
{"question":"Please explain what is \"BBC Model B\"","human_answers":["The British Broadcasting Corporation Microcomputer System, or BBC Micro, is a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by Acorn Computers in the 1980s for the BBC Computer Literacy Project. Designed with an emphasis on education, it was notable for its ruggedness, expandability, and the quality of its operating system. An accompanying 1982 television series, The Computer Programme, featuring Chris Serle learning to use the machine, was broadcast on BBC2.\nAfter the Literacy Project's call for bids for a computer to accompany the TV programmes and literature, Acorn won the contract with the Proton, a successor of its Atom computer prototyped at short notice. Renamed the BBC Micro, the system was adopted by most schools in the United Kingdom, changing Acorn's fortunes. It was also successful as a home computer in the UK, despite its high cost. Acorn later employed the machine to simulate and develop the ARM architecture.\nWhile nine models were eventually produced with the BBC brand, the phrase \"BBC Micro\" is usually used colloquially to refer to the first six (Model A, B, B+64, B+128, Master 128, and Master Compact); subsequent BBC models are considered part of Acorn's Archimedes series."],"chatgpt_answers":["The BBC Model B is a computer that was made by the British company Acorn Computers in 1981. It was based on the Acorn Proton, a microprocessor that was developed by Acorn specifically for use in home computers. The Model B was one of the first home computers to be widely available in the UK, and it was particularly popular with schools and educational institutions due to its low cost and ease of use. It had a 1 MHz CPU, 32 kilobytes of RAM (expandable to 64 kilobytes), and a built-in cassette tape drive for storing data. It was also equipped with a number of built-in peripherals, including a keyboard, a monitor, and a BBC Basic interpreter, which made it easy for users to program their own software.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"O level\"","human_answers":["The O-Level (Ordinary Level) is a subject-based qualification conferred as part of the General Certificate of Education. It was introduced in place of the School Certificate in 1951 as part of an educational reform alongside the more in-depth and academically rigorous A-Level (Advanced Level) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Those three jurisdictions replaced O-Level gradually with General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) completely by 1988 and, the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) over time. The Scottish equivalent was the O-grade (replaced by the Standard Grade).\nThe AO-Level (Alternative Ordinary Level) was formerly available in most subject areas. Sometimes incorrectly known as the Advanced Ordinary Level, the AO Level syllabus and examination both assumed a higher degree of maturity on the part of candidates, and employed teaching methods more commonly associated with A-Level study. The AO Level was discontinued, with final qualifications awarded in 1988.\nThe O-Level qualification is still awarded by CIE Cambridge International Examinations, the international counterpart of the British examination Board OCR (Oxford, Cambridge & Royal Society of Arts), in select locations, instead of or alongside the International General Certificate of Secondary Education qualifications.

{"question":"Please explain what is \"A level\"","human_answers":["The A-Level (Advanced Level) is a subject-based qualification conferred as part of the General Certificate of Education, as well as a school leaving qualification offered by the educational bodies in the United Kingdom and the educational authorities of British Crown dependencies to students completing secondary or pre-university education. They were introduced in England and Wales in 1951 to replace the Higher School Certificate.\nA number of Commonwealth countries have developed qualifications with the same name as and a similar format to the British A Levels. Obtaining an A Level, or equivalent qualifications, is generally required across the board for university entrance, with universities granting offers based on grades achieved. Particularly in Singapore, its A level examinations have been regarded as being much more challenging than the United Kingdom, with most universities offering lower entry qualifications with regard to grades achieved on a Singaporean A level certificate.\nA Levels are typically worked towards over two years. Normally, students take three or four A Level courses in their first year of sixth form, and most taking four cut back to three in their second year.[10] This is because university offers are normally based on three A Level grades, and taking a fourth can have an impact on grades. Unlike other level-3 qualifications, such as the International Baccalaureate, A Levels have no specific subject requirements, so students have the opportunity to combine any subjects they wish to take. However, students normally pick their courses based on the degree they wish to pursue at university: most degrees require specific A Levels for entry.[11]\nIn legacy modular courses (last assessment Summer 2019), A Levels are split into two parts, with students within their first year of study pursuing an Advanced Subsidiary qualification, commonly referred to as an AS or AS Level, which can either serve as an independent qualification or contribute 40% of the marks towards a full A Level award. The second part is known as an A2 or A2 Level, which is generally more in-depth and academically rigorous than the AS. The AS and A2 marks are combined for a full A Level award. The A2 Level is not a qualification on its own, and must be accompanied with an AS Level in the same subject for certification.[12]"],"chatgpt_answers":["A level, or Advanced level, is a qualification in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands that is typically studied by students during the ages of 16-18. A levels are offered in a wide range of subjects, including math, science, English, history, and languages. A levels are recognized by universities and employers as a benchmark of academic ability, and are often a requirement for admission to university in the UK.\n\n\n\nA levels are divided into two parts: AS (Advanced Subsidiary) level and A2 level. AS levels are typically studied in the first year of the A level program, and cover about half the material of the full A level course. A2 level exams are typically taken at the end of the second year of study.\n\n\n\nA levels are graded on a scale from A* to E, with A* being the highest grade and E being the lowest. A* and A grades are generally considered to be very good, while B, C, and D grades are considered to be good. An E grade is considered to be a pass, but is not typically considered to be a strong performance.\n\n\n\nIn addition to traditional A levels, students may also be able to take other qualifications, such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the Cambridge Pre-U, which are also recognized by universities as a means of gaining admission."]}
