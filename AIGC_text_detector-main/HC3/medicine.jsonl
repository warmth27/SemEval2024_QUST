I have seen the picture attached along with your complaint (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have severe dental fluorosis along with severe external stains. It is definitely possible to get whiter teeth with the help of dental veneers. Firstly the procedure includes complete thorough cleaning of the stains. Secondly the teeth visible in your smile zone will have to be prepared (ground slightly on the front surfaces) to fix in the dental veneers. Coming to the cost of the procedure,there are two types of veneers. One is composite veneers which has to be done in the clinic manually by the dentist. But this has short life and a major disadvantage of discoloration. Two, ceramic dental veneers which have to be made in the laboratory and then fixed on the prepared teeth. Ceramic ones are much suitable for you as it can long last and hide the brownish colour of your present teeth to a greater extent but this is expensive than composite ones. Ceramic veneers have different price ranges and it depends on your dentist and the laboratory. Discuss with the your dentist about it and choose your best suited range."],"chatgpt_answers":["It is possible to treat brown teeth due to fluoride staining by professional teeth whitening methods. The most effective method of whitening teeth that have been discolored by fluoride is through in-office bleaching, which is done by a dental professional. This method uses a stronger concentration of bleaching agents and a special light or laser to enhance the whitening process. It is typically more expensive than at-home whitening methods, but it can produce more dramatic results in a shorter period of time.\n\nOther treatment options for brown teeth due to fluoride staining include at-home bleaching kits that use lower concentrations of bleaching agents and take longer to produce results. These kits can be purchased over the counter or from a dental professional, and they generally cost less than in-office bleaching.\n\nIt is important to note that teeth whitening treatments are not permanent, and the results will eventually fade over time. To maintain the whiteness of your teeth, you may need to undergo regular touch-up treatments or use at-home maintenance products, such as whitening toothpaste or mouthwash.\n\nIt is also worth noting that fluoride is an important mineral that helps to protect the teeth from decay. If you are concerned about fluoride staining, you may want to speak with your dental professional about ways to reduce your exposure to fluoride, such as using a toothpaste that is low in fluoride or avoiding drinking water that has high levels of fluoride."]}

At 18 years age, you are too young to judge the size of  your penis. It is made up of muscles and the growth at puberty and adolescent is under the influence of testosterone. A research study was done in healthy Indian males on penis size during flaccid and erect and the width of the penis. Mean flaccid length was found to be 8.21 cm, mean stretched length 10.88 cm and circumference 9.14 cm. Mean erected length was found to be 13.01 cm and erected circumference was 11.46 cm. If your penis measurements are at least as mentioned above then there is no need to worry.Semen flowing with urine is a misconception in most men at your age.

It is a way for people to explore their own bodies and learn what feels good to them. Most people masturbate at some point in their lives, and it is generally not harmful or problematic.\n\nHowever, if you are masturbating to the point where it is interfering with your daily life or causing distress, it may be worth considering seeking help. For example, if you are masturbating multiple times a day and it is affecting your ability to attend to your daily responsibilities or you are experiencing feelings of guilt or shame around your masturbation habits, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional.\n\nIt is also important to note that frequent urination is not necessarily related to masturbation.

Low levels of serum albumin, also known as hypoalbuminemia, can be caused by various factors, including malnutrition, liver disease, and certain medications, such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) that are used to treat acid reflux.\n\nTo improve your serum albumin levels, it is important to address any underlying medical conditions that may be causing the deficiency. If you have liver disease or malnutrition, your healthcare provider may recommend specific treatment options to help improve your serum albumin levels. If you are taking PPIs and your serum albumin levels are low, your healthcare provider may recommend an alternative treatment for acid reflux or may suggest that you take a break from the PPIs to see if your serum albumin levels improve.\n\nIt is also important to maintain a healthy diet that includes a variety of protein-rich foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts.

Women sometimes don't ovulate at the same time as usual, and other factors, such as weight changes, travel, and stress, can also make your cycle abnormal.Furthermore, in your particular case, your husband has been sterilized.  And you had a pregnancy test that was negative, which is just as accurate as the ones in a doctor's office.So I think you do not have to worry about being pregnant.To be totally secure about your husband's sterility, he could get a sperm count done to make sure the vasectomy worked, if you would find that reassuring.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"],"chatgpt_answers":["Yes, frequent urination, nausea, and enlarged breasts can be symptoms of pregnancy.

A healthcare provider can perform a physical examination and possibly order additional tests, such as a pregnancy test or an ultrasound, to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIt is also important to note that, despite having a vasectomy, there is still a small chance that your husband could father a child.

How to correct bedwetting of a 9 year old?Hi doctor,My child, who is 9 years old, has bedwetting problem. Please suggest me.\nBedwetting, also known as enuresis, is a common problem among children, and it is usually not a cause for concern. Most children outgrow bedwetting on their own, and treatment is usually not necessary. However, if your child's bedwetting is causing distress or problems, there are several things you can try to help your child stop wetting the bed:\n\nEncourage your child to go to the bathroom before bedtime and make sure they empty their bladder completely.\n\nConsider using an alarm system to wake your child up when they start to wet the bed. These alarms can be purchased online or at a medical supply store.\n\nTry to reduce your child's fluid intake in the evening, particularly caffeine-containing drinks like soda and chocolate.\n\nConsider using a bedwetting product, such as a moisture-absorbing mattress pad or a bedwetting alarm that attaches to your child's clothing.\n\nTalk to your child's doctor about whether medication might be helpful in managing the bedwetting.\n\nIt's important to be patient and understanding with your child as they learn to control their bladder.

How to correct bedwetting of a 9 year old?Hi doctor,My child, who is 9 years old, has bedwetting problem. Please suggest me.\nBedwetting, also known as nocturnal enuresis, is a common problem among children, especially those who are around 9 years old. It is important to note that bedwetting is not a behavioral issue and is often caused by a combination of factors, including a child's bladder size and the production of a hormone called vasopressin, which helps the body retain water during sleep.\n\nThere are several strategies you can try to help your child stop bedwetting:\n\nEncourage your child to use the bathroom before going to bed. This can help reduce the amount of urine in the bladder and decrease the chances of bedwetting.\n\nSet a bedwetting alarm. These alarms are designed to wake your child when they start to wet the bed, allowing them to go to the bathroom and finish voiding.\n\nLimit your child's fluid intake before bedtime. Encourage your child to drink fluids earlier in the evening and avoid giving them drinks that contain caffeine, which can stimulate the bladder.\n\nEncourage your child to relax before bed. Stress and anxiety can contribute to bedwetting, so try to create a calming bedtime routine and encourage your child to relax before going to sleep.\n\nUse a bedwetting protector. These special mattress covers or pads can help protect your child's bed and make clean-up easier.\n\nIt is important to be patient and understanding with your child as they work to stop bedwetting. In most cases, bedwetting resolves on its own as children grow and their bodies mature. If your child's bedwetting persists despite your efforts or if it is causing significant distress, it is a good idea to consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance.","ChatGPT Dec 15 Version.

Duoluton for 3 days. Duoluton is Progesterone preparation. Progesterone causes secretory changes in the lining of uterus (endometrium). After 3 days you discontinued Duoluton; hence you were expected to get the withdrawal bleeding after 4-7 days, which you got. In fact if you are to be put on Progestational medicine for the support throughout the cycle, I would advise you to go for retroprogesterone preparations throughout the cycle so that they would not hamper egg release. If you discontinue these medicines in between, you will get withdrawal bleeding. Now as far as the low sperm count of your husband is concerned, your doctors have suggested you and taken the decision of IUI which you should follow. Please start ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. When the follicle is between 18 mm to 21 mm size AND the endometrial thickness is between 9 mm to 14 mm, it is the most ideal time for IUI.

I understand your concern.  -  IT's natural for you to be worried following two miscarriages. But in my view, when you already know that your pregnancy is normal.. you should not be psychologically stressed... taking care is needed, but stress & tension can have adverse effect of pregnancy.   * Actually frequency of urination& frequent urge ( may be taken as tightening .. is normal in early pregnancy, due to pressure of growing fetus presses on  the urinary bladder. .. as a result there is no complete empting of bladder & the symptoms.   - Try to pass urine in  forward bendsng position with hands resting on knee. This relieves pressure on bladder.. it empties completely & there is no frequent urge& stretching!   *  If you are not relieved with this -    Please consult your treating doctor, tell about your tightening before urination. he will advise you-     - Get urine checked for any infection\/ HSG\/ Progesterone  assessment to determine hormonal sufficiency  & will prescribe needful medicines .   * Actually you had 2 abortions in past.. routinely such patients are given Progesterone supplements ( as a preventive measure ) till 12-14 weeks are completed.    You can discuss with your doctor about the supplements ( actually you must be already been prescribed  ).. . As the hormone supports pregnancy , your tension would be relieved.   Thanks."],"chatgpt_answers":["During pregnancy, the uterus expands to accommodate the growing fetus. This can cause a tightening sensation in the pelvic area.

However, if you are experiencing severe pain or discomfort, or if you have any concerns about your pregnancy, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider.

Without more information, it's difficult to recommend specific medications. However, there are a few potential causes of red, itchy spots on the face that might be relevant in your case.\n\nOne potential cause is contact dermatitis, which is a type of skin irritation that occurs when the skin comes into contact with certain substances. This can be triggered by things like makeup, skincare products, and fabrics, as well as by irritants like pollutants and chemicals. If you suspect that your red, itchy spots may be caused by contact dermatitis, you may want to try avoiding the substances that seem to trigger your symptoms and using a hypoallergenic moisturizer to help soothe your skin. Over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream may also be helpful in reducing inflammation and itching.\n\nAnother potential cause of red, itchy spots on the face is seborrheic dermatitis, which is a condition that causes a red, scaly rash on the face, scalp, and other areas of the body. It is often accompanied by itching and can be triggered by a variety of factors, including hormonal changes, stress, and certain medications. If you think you may have seborrheic dermatitis, you may want to try using an over-the-counter antifungal cream or shampoo to help control the condition.\n\nIf your red, itchy spots do not improve with self-care measures, or if you are experiencing other symptoms such as fever, difficulty breathing, or swelling, it's important to see a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.

It can be caused by a variety of factors, including scarring of the heart tissue, inflammation, or abnormalities in the heart's structure.\n\nMild mitral regurgitation (MR) refers to a condition in which the mitral valve, which separates the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart, does not close properly.

Specifically, the right bundle branch, which is a group of fibers in the heart that carries electrical signals to the right ventricle, is not functioning properly.

RBBB is usually not a serious condition, but it may require further evaluation to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.\n\nMild mitral regurgitation is a type of heart valve disorder that occurs when the mitral valve, which is located between the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart, is not closing properly.

However, it is important to have a healthcare provider evaluate any significant differences in testicle size, as it could be a sign of a medical condition. Some potential causes of a testicle being larger in an infant include:\n\nUndescended testicle: An undescended testicle is a testicle that has not moved down into the scrotum. This is a common condition in infants, and it usually resolves on its own within the first few months of life. However, if the testicle does not descend by the time the child is six months old, surgery may be needed to move it into the scrotum.\n\nHernia: A hernia is a protrusion of abdominal contents through a weakness in the abdominal wall. In infants, a hernia may cause a testicle to appear larger than normal. Hernias can be repaired surgically.\n\nTesticular torsion: Testicular torsion is a condition in which the testicle becomes twisted, cutting off its blood supply. Testicular torsion can cause severe pain and requires prompt surgical treatment.\n\nIt is important to have your child evaluated by a healthcare provider to determine the cause of the difference in testicle size and to determine the appropriate treatment, if necessary."]}

Children at this age are still developing their immune systems and are more susceptible to illness and infections, and exposing them to these types of environments may increase their risk of getting sick. Additionally, the noise and crowds at a party can be overwhelming for a young child and may cause them to become distressed.\n\nIt is important to consider the well-being of your child and whether the environment is suitable for them. It may be a better idea to find a babysitter or leave your child at home with a trusted caregiver while you attend the party.

A posterior tibial stress fracture is a type of fracture that occurs in the bone that runs along the inside of the lower leg (the tibia). This type of fracture is often caused by overuse or repetitive stress on the bone, which can occur during activities such as running or playing sports.\n\nIf you think you may have a posterior tibial stress fracture, it's important to stop participating in activities that may be causing the fracture to worsen and to seek medical attention. Your doctor can examine you and order imaging tests, such as an x-ray or MRI, to determine the extent of the fracture and recommend the appropriate treatment. Treatment for a posterior tibial stress fracture may include rest, physical therapy, and in some cases, surgery.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try the following self-care measures to help manage the pain and reduce the risk of further injury:\n\nRest: It's important to rest the affected leg and avoid activities that may cause further stress on the bone.\n\nIce: Applying an ice pack to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time can help reduce inflammation and numb the area to provide pain relief.\n\nCompression: Wearing a compression bandage or sleeve can help reduce swelling and provide support to the affected area.\n\nElevation: Elevating the affected leg above the level of your heart can help reduce swelling.\n\nOver-the-counter pain medication: Taking over-the-counter pain medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help reduce inflammation and manage pain.\n\nIt's important to follow your doctor's recommendations for treatment and to seek medical attention if you experience any worsening of symptoms or if the pain does not improve with self-care measures."]}

Now, how would I know if I am pregnant?\nIf you have missed your Depot shot and are concerned about the possibility of pregnancy, it is important to take a pregnancy test to confirm whether or not you are pregnant. The Depot injection is a long-acting form of birth control that contains the hormone progestin. It is administered by injection every three months and is intended to prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary). If you have missed a shot, it is possible that you may not be fully protected from pregnancy.\n\nThere are several types of pregnancy tests available, including home tests that can be purchased at a pharmacy or online. These tests work by detecting the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone that is produced by the placenta after fertilization and is present in the urine of pregnant women. Pregnancy tests are generally accurate when used correctly, but it is important to follow the instructions carefully and to read the results within the recommended time frame.\n\nIf you think you may be pregnant or are experiencing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, or missed periods, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider as soon as possible. They can provide you with further information and advice on how to proceed."]}

{"question":"How can a dog bite infection be treated?I was bit by my own dog.....not a deep bit at all. However, he has nipped at me a couple of times in the past and each time I ve had to get antibiotics because it got infected....and this bite seems to be getting infected. My skin is extremely sensitive. I have some Bactrim DS left from an ear infection and I am wondering if I can take that for this skin infection?","human_answers":["Hello,Sorry to hear that you were bitten by a dog.  It is reassuring knowing you were bitten by your own dog as opposed to a feral dog because wild dogs carry much more bacteria and even rabies.  The use of antibiotics for prophylactics is controversial.  The first-line oral therapy is amoxicillin-clavulanate. For higher-risk infections, a first dose of antibiotic may be given intravenously.  Bactrim is a medicine that is used in various animal bites but it is not the first choice based on the types of bacteria generally contained in dog bites.  However, if you are to use it, you need to get a full dosage and not just whatever is left over from a previous infection."],"chatgpt_answers":["It's important to properly clean and treat a dog bite as soon as possible to prevent infection. Here's what you can do:\n\nWash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Do this for at least 5 minutes to help remove any bacteria from the wound.\n\nApply a disinfectant to the wound. You can use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine.\n\nCover the wound with a sterile bandage. This will help keep it clean and protected.\n\nKeep the wound elevated. This will help reduce swelling.\n\nTake over-the-counter pain medication as needed. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce pain and inflammation.\n\nWatch for signs of infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, or drainage from the wound. If you notice any of these signs, you should contact a healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n\nAs for taking Bactrim DS for the infection, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any medication. Bactrim DS is a prescription antibiotic that is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, but it may not be the most appropriate treatment for a skin infection. It's always best to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment for your specific situation. They can assess the severity of the infection and recommend the most effective treatment.","It's important to seek medical attention as soon as possible after a dog bite, even if the bite does not appear to be serious.

{"question":"Is \"follicle size of 18mm with endometrial thickness of 5.7mm\" a side effect of 'fertyl'?Hi i am 30 years old. This cycle i took fertyl 50mg starting 3 day for 5 days. Follicle monitoring done on 11 january shows follicle of size 18mm but endometrial thickness is just 5.7mm. Is this the side effect of fertyl. Will progynova 2mg help solve the problem. Last menstruation period date was 3 january.","human_answers":["Hallow, Fertyl is clomiphene citrate. It is basically used for egg release (ovulation) where natural ovulation is a problem. It is in particular useful in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome where the follicles are maturing to varied extent and still the ovulation failure is noted. Clomiphene citrate is also having antioestrogenic effect. So it may hamper  growth of endometrium. Hence, in women where Endometrial growth is low, gonadotropin hormones may be preferred for induction of ovulation. Endometrial thickness between 9 mm to 13 mm has proved to be most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum or blastocyst. Ovulation occurring when endometrium is just 5.7 mm is likely to end in 'no pregnancy'.So long as the follicular size is concerned, it has been reported for many decades that the ova discharged from the follicles of size between 18 mm to 21 mm are the healthiest one and give maximum fertilization rate and continuation of pregnancy success rate. Progynova is a synthetic hormone replacement for oestrogen. It is used to build up the lining of the uterus in preparation for embryo transfer during a thaw cycle for women who do not ovulate regularly. Hence in your case, it might prove to be effective in building up the endometrium. However, you should not wait for the ovulation beyond the follicular size more than 21 mm. If it takes longer for the endometrium to grow, you may waste this cycle and start Progynova earlier in next cycle and have ovulation at proper follicular size. I hope this information is useful to you for further decisions. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"],"chatgpt_answers":["Fertyl (clomiphene) is a medication that is commonly used to treat fertility problems in women. It is typically used to stimulate the development of multiple eggs in the ovaries, which can increase the chances of pregnancy.\n\nThe size of the follicles and the thickness of the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) can be affected by various factors, including hormonal changes, age, and underlying health conditions. It is not uncommon for these values to vary from cycle to cycle and person to person.\n\nIt is possible that the size of your follicles and the thickness of your endometrium have been affected by the use of Fertyl, but without more information, it is difficult to say for sure. It is important to discuss any concerns you have with your healthcare provider, who can assess your specific situation and advise you on the best course of action.\n\nProgynova (estradiol) is a hormone medication that is sometimes used to help prepare the endometrium for pregnancy. It is not clear if taking Progynova will help solve the problem you are experiencing, as this will depend on the underlying cause of the issue.

The external stains may go with scaling and polishing but this does not result in whitening.Whitening of teeth is an entirely different procedure in which teeth lighten by 3-4 shades from the normal colour or sometimes even more. this procedure is commonly referred to as bleaching. There are 2 types of whitening procedure. one is done in clinic called inoffice procedure and the other is done by the patient in the house called home whitening. If you desire whitening, please consult your dentist for the same.Regards"],"chatgpt_answers":["It's possible that scaling may be necessary if you have yellow stains on your teeth that cannot be removed with regular cleaning. Scaling is a procedure that removes plaque and tartar from the surface of the teeth, and it can be performed by a dentist or dental hygienist. However, it's important to understand that scaling is not always the solution for yellow teeth. There are a number of other factors that can cause teeth to turn yellow, such as:\n\nAging: As we get older, our teeth naturally become less white due to wear and tear and exposure to staining agents like coffee, tea, and tobacco.\n\nMedications: Some medications, such as tetracycline, can cause tooth discoloration.\n\nPoor oral hygiene: Poor oral hygiene can lead to a build-up of plaque and tartar on the teeth, which can cause them to turn yellow.\n\nTrauma: Teeth can become discolored if they have been traumatized, such as by a blow to the mouth.\n\nIf you have yellow teeth, it's important to visit a dentist to determine the cause and the best course of treatment. In some cases, teeth whitening may be a more appropriate option than scaling. Your dentist can help you determine the best course of action based on the specific cause of your yellow teeth."]}

I have been having  severe headaches. My  esr  increased from  35 t0 55 even when i had taken 250 mg proximexa  as advised by my doctor since he suspected infection. why did my esr increase after 3 days of antibiotics?","human_answers":["ESR is a nonspecific test indicating the presence of an inflammatory condition. This could be due to an infection or to many other causes. The inflammatory process and the change in ESR could be due to the infection and would occur regardless of antibiotic treatment- it is part of the body's response to the infection. If the infection clears up with treatment, the inflammatory process will start to clear up, but signs of it such as the ESR may take some time to return to normal. The ESR is not useful for following the course of an infection. Again, it may also be due to an entirely different condition from the infection, such as arthritis, lupus, response to injuries, etc etc. Hope this helps."],"chatgpt_answers":["Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a blood test that measures the rate at which red blood cells (erythrocytes) sediment in a tube over a period of time. It is not a specific test for any particular disease, but it can be elevated in a variety of conditions, including infections, inflammation, and certain types of cancer. It is not uncommon for ESR to increase slightly in response to an infection, as the body's immune system responds to the infection by releasing substances that can cause inflammation.\n\nThere are several reasons why ESR may increase after starting antibiotics:\n\nThe infection is causing inflammation: As mentioned above, ESR can be elevated in response to inflammation, and infections can often cause inflammation. If the infection is causing inflammation, then ESR may increase as the body's immune system responds to the infection.\n\nThe antibiotics are causing inflammation: Some antibiotics can cause inflammation as a side effect. This is not a common side effect, but it is possible. If the antibiotics you are taking are causing inflammation, then ESR may increase as a result.\n\nThe infection is not responding to the antibiotics: If the infection is not responding to the antibiotics, then ESR may continue to increase despite treatment. This could be due to a number of factors, such as antibiotic resistance or an underlying condition that is making it difficult for the antibiotics to work effectively.\n\nIt is important to note that ESR is not a specific test for infection, and the presence of an infection does not necessarily mean that ESR will be elevated. Similarly, an increase in ESR does not necessarily mean that an infection is present. It is important to discuss any concerns or questions you have about your ESR with your healthcare provider. They can help interpret the results of your ESR test and determine the best course of treatment based on your individual situation."]}

{"question":"Q. Kindly suggest the glasses that can be used while working on laptop.Hello doctor,I am 27 years old, male, pursuing PG. This is the dissertation writing time for me. For that, I have to rely on a laptop most of the time. It makes my eyes uncomfortable (red and dry). So, would be glad to have suggestions. Any glasses that I could use while working on a laptop?","human_answers":["Hi. People who spend much time in front of digital screens like a laptop, mobiles, etc., are at higher risk of developing dry eyes also called computer eye syndrome. Usually, we blink 8 to 12 times per minute but while using digital devices blink rate is decreased 2 to 3 times per minute. That is why tear film is disturbed and eyes get dry. So keep using Refresh Tears and try to modify the habits like blinking every 10 to 15 seconds during laptop use and try to avoid any humid environment. I hope these simple things will help you a lot."],"chatgpt_answers":["Using glasses specifically designed for computer use may help reduce eye strain and discomfort while working on a laptop. These glasses often have a special coating that filters out blue light, which is a type of light that is emitted by computer screens and can contribute to eye strain. They may also have a larger lens area to help reduce the amount of dry air that hits your eyes, which can cause dryness and discomfort.\n\nIt's a good idea to have an eye exam to determine if you have any specific vision problems that may be causing your eye discomfort while using a laptop. An eye doctor can recommend the best glasses for your needs, taking into account your individual vision prescription and any other factors that may be contributing to your eye discomfort.\n\nIn addition to using specialized computer glasses, there are a few other things you can do to reduce eye strain and discomfort while working on a laptop:\n\nTake frequent breaks: Make sure to take breaks from looking at your screen every 20 minutes or so. Close your eyes for a few seconds or look away from the screen and focus on something in the distance.\n\nBlink frequently: Blinking helps to moisten and refresh your eyes, which can help reduce dryness and discomfort.\n\nAdjust your screen: Make sure your screen is at a comfortable distance and angle, and adjust the brightness and contrast to a level that is comfortable for you.\n\nUse proper lighting: Avoid working in a room with bright or harsh lighting, as this can contribute to eye strain. Instead, try to work in a room with softer, indirect lighting.\n\nUse a humidifier: Dry air can contribute to eye dryness and discomfort. Using a humidifier can help add moisture to the air and reduce dryness."]}

There is ongoing debate about the safety of amalgam fillings, with some concerns about the potential health effects of the mercury they contain.

In addition, your dentist should provide you with a mouthguard to wear during the procedure to protect your oral tissues and reduce the amount of vapor you inhale.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind that the removal of amalgam fillings carries some risks, such as the possibility of damaging the tooth or surrounding tissues.

Dr said it s probable that I ll get the use of hands back as double crush. Having EMG done soon. Also have have herniation C-3 & C-7. Dr wants me to have pt for neck, but my neck hurts just turning it.","human_answers":["Hello and Welcome to \u2018Ask A Doctor\u2019 service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Several features of pain can be helpful in clarifying what is going on and the next steps for diagnosis and treatment.Type of pain: Burning mostly means a nerve is having problems. This can be either a sick nerve or a nerve that has had an injury. Electrical, shooting would be others implying nerve source for pain.Location of pain: There is a lot to this. First, if something goes in the pathway of a nerve, then that is the nerve involved. Nerves are long and the pain is in a belt-like long pathway. Smaller areas are smaller nerves. This also tends to say what might be going on. Obviously if there was an injury to the area and then there was pain outward from it \"hit a nerve\" would be a possibility. Sick nerves are multiple areas and tend to be the TIPS of the nerve not the whole nerve.What hurts: Moving a particular way that triggers the pain tells what is hurting. Specifically it can distinguish outward structures like skin, muscles, tendons, joints from deep structures like organs and nerves.There is the pain. There is the context of it. If it is getting less that is perceived as good regardless of the pain. If the patient is making a lot of pain, then after the patient, the pain is less.Pain exists, at multiple levels of abstraction. There is how it is held. Producing the pain by oneself (patient) changes this and generally helps. Having a control of the pain helps.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."],"chatgpt_answers":["I'm sorry to hear about your neck pain and other medical issues. Neck pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle strain, nerve impingement, and spinal degeneration or injury. It is important to work with a healthcare professional to determine the cause of your neck pain and to develop a treatment plan that is appropriate for your specific needs.\n\nTreatment options for neck pain may include physical therapy, medications, injection therapies, and in some cases, surgery. Physical therapy can help to stretch and strengthen the muscles in the neck and upper back, which can help to alleviate pain and improve range of motion. Medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and muscle relaxants, may be prescribed to help reduce inflammation and muscle spasms. Injection therapies, such as corticosteroid injections or nerve blocks, may be used to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain.\n\nIf your neck pain is severe or does not respond to conservative treatments, your healthcare provider may recommend surgery. There are several different surgical procedures that may be used to treat neck pain, including fusion surgery, which involves joining two or more vertebrae together to stabilize the spine.\n\nIt is important to follow the treatment plan recommended by your healthcare provider and to communicate any concerns or changes in your symptoms. It is also important to take steps to prevent neck pain, such as practicing good posture, using ergonomic equipment, and taking breaks from activities that may cause strain on the neck."]}

The only thing which I was going across is that you have sustained three or four fractures in the past six years which if there is no significant history of trauma in previous episodes, needs further evaluation, but if there was a history of significant injury then its fine. As for the present condition, I would like to state that in patients with healthy bone metabolism and no underlying pathology, there should not be any fracture without a history of any significant trauma at your age. So, I would advise you for, 1. Crepe bandage for compression, if you can use a wrist brace for two to three weeks, it is even better. 2. Gentle anti-inflammatory medication like Ibuprofen, Paracetamol, etc., can be used for pain relief on SOS basis. 3. Ice packs should be used three to four times in a day, 10 to 15 minutes every time to keep swelling and pain to bare minimum.

The report you provided describes several findings on the MRI scan.\n\nA lacunar infarct is a type of small stroke that occurs when a small blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked, disrupting blood flow to a small area of brain tissue. The presence of a small chronic lacunar infarct means that there is a small area of brain tissue that has been damaged due to a previous stroke.\n\nA dilated perivascular space is a small fluid-filled area around a blood vessel in the brain. The presence of a dilated perivascular space in the posterior left centrum semiolale suggests that there may be some swelling or inflammation in this area of the brain.\n\nThe MRI report also mentions a small chronic lacunar infarct in the left thalamus, which is an area of the brain involved in movement, sensory processing, and regulation of sleep and wakefulness.\n\nThe report states that there is no evidence of restricted diffusion, which means that the MRI did not detect any areas of the brain that are experiencing a sudden lack of blood flow, which can occur during an acute stroke.\n\nThe report mentions that there is a mildly prominent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) overlying the cerebral hemispheres, which may be due to moderate generalized cerebral and cerebellar volume loss. This means that there is an abnormal amount of CSF present in the brain, which may be due to a decrease in the volume of brain tissue.\n\nThe ventricles and basilar cisterns, which are fluid-filled spaces within the brain, are described as being normal in size.\n\nOverall, the MRI report suggests that there are some areas of brain tissue damage and swelling present, but no evidence of an acute stroke or other serious brain injury.

It is important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing these symptoms, as asthma can be managed with proper treatment.\n\nTreatment for asthma typically involves the use of medications to control inflammation and open the airways, as well as avoiding triggers that can worsen symptoms.

In addition to taking medications, it is important to avoid triggers that can worsen asthma symptoms, such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, and certain chemicals.

It could be a swollen lymph node, which is a small, round, bean-shaped structure that is part of the body's immune system. Lymph nodes can become swollen in response to infection, inflammation, or other types of injury.\n\nAnother possibility is that the lump could be a cyst, which is a closed sac containing fluid, pus, or other material. Cysts can occur anywhere on the body and are usually benign (not cancerous). They can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, inflammation, or blockages in the glands or ducts.\n\nIt is also possible that the lump could be a hematoma, which is a collection of blood that has escaped from a damaged blood vessel. Hematomas can occur as a result of trauma or injury, such as a blow to the area or a surgical procedure.\n\nIt is important to have the lump checked by a healthcare provider to determine the cause and determine the appropriate treatment, if necessary. The provider will likely perform a physical examination, ask about your medical history and any recent injuries or infections, and may order additional tests, such as a blood test or imaging study, to help determine the cause of the lump."]}

HIV is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids, and the lining of the anus is more prone to tearing and exposure to HIV than the lining of the vagina or mouth. This means that the risk of HIV transmission during anal sex is higher than during other sexual activities.\n\nThe chances of getting HIV after unprotected anal sex depend on several factors, including the HIV status of the partner, the presence of other STIs, and the presence of any cuts or abrasions on the skin. It is also important to consider the prevalence of HIV in the community where the sexual encounter took place, as HIV is more common in some populations than others.\n\nIf you are concerned about the possibility of HIV transmission, it is important to get tested as soon as possible. HIV testing should be done at least 3-6 weeks after potential exposure, as it can take that long for the virus to be detectable in the body. You can also be tested for other STIs at this time. It is important to note that some STIs, including HIV, may not show up on a test until several weeks or even months after infection, so it is important to practice safe sex and get tested regularly to ensure that you are not unknowingly transmitting HIV or other STIs to your partners."]}

If you are too apprehensive tell your doctor that apply some local anesthesia at the site of the prick, you will then even not feel the prick too."],"chatgpt_answers":["It's understandable that you may be feeling anxious about getting a shot and having wisdom tooth removal surgery. However, there are steps that can be taken to help make you more comfortable during the procedure.\n\nFirst, it's important to choose a dental or oral surgeon that you feel comfortable with and trust. Having a good relationship with your surgeon can help put you at ease. You can also discuss your concerns with the surgeon beforehand and ask about the type of anesthesia that will be used and how it will be administered.\n\nThere are several types of anesthesia that can be used for wisdom tooth removal, including local anesthesia, intravenous (IV) sedation, and general anesthesia. Local anesthesia numbs the area around the tooth and is often used in combination with other forms of anesthesia. IV sedation involves the administration of medications through a vein to help you relax and feel drowsy. General anesthesia is administered through an IV or by inhaling gases and results in a deep sleep, so you will not be aware of the procedure.\n\nYour surgeon will determine the best type of anesthesia for you based on factors such as the complexity of the procedure, your medical history, and your level of anxiety. You should discuss your preferences with the surgeon and ask any questions you have about the anesthesia.\n\nIt's also a good idea to have a friend or family member present during the procedure to provide support and comfort. They can stay with you in the waiting room or the recovery area and be there when you wake up.\n\nFinally, try to relax and take deep breaths during the procedure. This can help calm your nerves and make the experience more comfortable."]}

Bruises form when small blood vessels, known as capillaries, break and leak blood into the surrounding tissue. The blood that leaks out can cause a discoloration of the skin, which is what we see as a bruise.\n\nThere are many potential causes of bruises, including physical injury, certain medical conditions, and certain medications. It's possible that you may have bruised yourself without realizing it, perhaps by bumping into something or by engaging in activities that put physical strain on your neck and chest. If you can't think of any specific incident that might have caused the bruise, it's possible that it could be a sign of a more serious underlying medical condition.\n\nIf you're concerned about the bruise, it's always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional.

The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine and is located just after the stomach, so a feeding tube placed in the duodenum allows nutrition to bypass the damaged esophagus and be delivered directly to the small intestine, where it can be absorbed and used by the body.\n\nInserting a feeding tube into the duodenum is typically done through a procedure called a duodenostomy. This involves making a small incision in the abdomen and inserting the feeding tube through the incision and into the duodenum. Duodenostomy may be preferred over inserting the feeding tube into the stomach (gastrostomy) because the duodenum is closer to the liver and may be more efficient at absorbing nutrients. Additionally, the duodenum has a thinner wall than the stomach and may be less prone to irritation from the feeding tube.\n\nIt is important to note that a feeding tube is not the only option for providing nutrition to a patient with esophageal cancer. Other options may include a liquid diet, medications to help with swallowing, or placing a stent in the esophagus to keep it open and allow for easier swallowing. The best approach will depend on the specific circumstances of the patient and will be determined by the healthcare team."]}

If your child is refusing to eat a variety of foods, it may be helpful to involve your child in meal planning and preparation, as this can help to increase their interest in trying new foods. You may also want to consider speaking with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian for additional guidance and support."]}

These pimples, called neonatal acne, are caused by hormones that are passed from the mother to the baby before birth. They usually appear within the first few weeks of life and resolve on their own within a few months.\n\nTo help prevent or treat neonatal acne, you can try the following measures:\n\nKeep your baby's skin clean by washing their face with water and a mild, fragrance-free baby soap or cleansing bar. Avoid using harsh or medicated cleansers.\n\nPat the skin dry gently after washing. Avoid rubbing the skin or using hot water, as this can irritate the pimples and make them worse.\n\nAvoid applying lotions, creams, or oils to the affected area, as these can clog the pores and make the acne worse.\n\nIf the acne persists or becomes more severe, you may want to consult a pediatrician for further evaluation and treatment. They may recommend a mild topical medication or other treatment options.\n\nAs for the hair on your baby's body, it is not uncommon for newborns to have a lot of hair, especially on their face.

If the above situation happens at three or four places on his body simultaneously by an HIV-infected mosquito, what is the possibility of HIV transmission by this method?\nThere is no risk of HIV transmission through mosquitoes. HIV is a virus that affects humans and other primates, and it cannot replicate or survive in the bodies of insects such as mosquitoes. Mosquitoes do not transmit HIV when they bite humans.\n\nIn fact, HIV cannot survive outside the body for very long. The virus is fragile and is easily damaged by exposure to air, heat, and light. Therefore, it is not possible for HIV to be transmitted through mosquitoes or any other type of insect.\n\nIt is important to note that HIV is primarily transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. The most common ways to contract HIV are through sexual contact, sharing needles, and mother-to-child transmission during childbirth or breastfeeding. It is important to practice safe sex, avoid sharing needles, and get tested regularly to reduce the risk of HIV transmission."]}

However, we need to rule out the possibility of structural heart disease before calling them benign. So, echo should be obtained to rule out possibility of structural heart disease. Also, thyroid problems can cause these, so thyroid profile should be obtained. Also, too much coffee, sleep deprivation, stress, alcohol and other addictions may cause those, so should be minimized, if any.

Yasmin is a combined oral contraceptive pill that contains two different hormones viz. estrogen and progesterone. Taking these pills can cause hormonal balance which helps the yeast to grow.

These sugars feed the yeast already living in the vagina causing overgrowth and thus infection (vaginal thrush or candidiasis). It is a similar effect to that seen in pregnancy when estrogen levels rise naturally. If the infection bothers you too much you could be switched to a different kind of contraceptive pill with a stronger progesterone component and a weaker estrogen component or consider going on the mini-pill which only contains progesterone.

Some possible causes of pain behind the knees include:\n\nPopliteal artery entrapment syndrome: This condition occurs when the popliteal artery, which supplies blood to the lower leg, becomes compressed or trapped behind the knee. This can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the lower leg.\n\nBaker's cyst: A Baker's cyst, also known as a popliteal cyst, is a fluid-filled sac that can develop behind the knee. This can cause swelling and pain behind the knee, as well as difficulty bending the knee.\n\nTendinitis: Inflammation of the tendons in the back of the knee can cause pain and stiffness.\n\nArthritis: Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis can both cause pain and swelling in the joints, including the knee.\n\nIf your grandson is experiencing sharp pain, tingling, and difficulty moving his legs, he should seek medical attention as soon as possible. It is always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to potential health concerns.

Melasma can be difficult to treat and may require a combination of treatments to be effective.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to help reduce the appearance of melasma:\n\nWear sunscreen: It is important to protect your skin from the sun, as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light can worsen melasma. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and apply it to your face and other exposed skin every day.\n\nAvoid certain triggers: Certain things can trigger or worsen melasma, such as certain skin care products, hormones (including birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy), and certain medications. Try to identify any potential triggers and avoid them if possible.\n\nUse lightening agents: Several topical lightening agents are available that can help to lighten the appearance of melasma. These include hydroquinone, azelaic acid, kojic acid, and vitamin C. These agents can be used alone or in combination with other treatments.\n\nConsider chemical peels: Chemical peels can help to remove the top layers of skin, revealing brighter, smoother skin underneath.

It is important to have the odor evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the cause and proper treatment.\n\nIf your mother is diabetic, it is particularly important to have the odor evaluated, as diabetics have an increased risk of developing foot problems due to poor circulation and decreased sensation in their feet.\n\nTo address the odor in the meantime, you can try the following steps:\n\nKeep the area clean and dry. Wash the affected toe and the surrounding skin daily with soap and water, and dry thoroughly.\n\nTrim the toenail. Trim the toenail carefully, making sure not to cut it too short or round the edges too much, as this can increase the risk of ingrown toenails.\n\nUse an antifungal powder. Sprinkle an antifungal powder, such as miconazole or terbinafine, on the affected toe and in your mother's socks and shoes to help prevent the growth of fungi and bacteria.\n\nChange socks and shoes frequently. Wearing clean, dry socks and shoes can help prevent the buildup of moisture, which can lead to fungal and bacterial infections.\n\nIt is important to have the odor evaluated by a healthcare professional as soon as possible to determine the cause and proper treatment.

Though it is not absolutely clear from your history whether you have missed your period or not, the impression I got is you have not missed period.

Breast symptoms: Engorgement with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples and areola with increase in areolar size, Montgomery's tubercles under areola and secretions from the nipples. Pain is not a feature of normal uneventful pregnancy without any risk. Appearance of pain anytime during pregnancy is indicative of some risk to the pregnancy. If you have missed your period, you can confirm the diagnosis of pregnancy by performing pregnancy test on overnight first early morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period. Earlier these tests may give false negative results. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before missing period.

An apicolordotic view is a type of chest x-ray that is taken from a specific angle and may be used to better visualize the lung tissue and any abnormalities present.\n\nIt's important to follow up with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and to determine the cause of the questionable infiltrates in your upper left lobe.

It is characterized by obsessions, which are unwanted and intrusive thoughts, images, or urges that cause anxiety or distress, and compulsions, which are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession.\n\nTreatment for OCD often involves a combination of medications and therapy. Fluoxetine, which is a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is often used to treat OCD. SSRIs work by increasing the levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger in the brain that is involved in mood and behavior.\n\nWhile there is no known \"cure\" for OCD, treatment can be very effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. It is important to work with a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, to determine the best treatment plan for you. Therapy options for OCD include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention (ERP), which have been shown to be effective in treating OCD.\n\nIt is not uncommon for people with OCD to need long-term treatment to manage their symptoms. However, it is possible for some people to eventually taper off or stop taking medication or to reduce the frequency of therapy sessions. It is important to work closely with your treatment team and follow their recommendations for care."]}

For example, if you tend to daydream while sitting in a boring lecture, try to find ways to make the lecture more engaging or break it up with breaks or other activities.\n\nSet specific goals and deadlines: Having clear goals and deadlines can help you stay focused and motivated, and can make it less tempting to daydream.\n\nPractice mindfulness: Paying attention to the present moment can help you stay grounded and focused. Try incorporating mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, into your daily routine.\n\nFind an activity that engages you: If you find yourself daydreaming when you're feeling bored or unengaged, try finding an activity that fully engages your mind and attention. This could be a hobby, a puzzle, or even just a challenging task.\n\nSeek support: If you're finding it difficult to control your daydreaming on your own, consider seeking support from a mental health professional or a trusted friend or family member. They can help you identify any underlying issues that may be contributing to your daydreaming and develop strategies to manage it."]}

If your front teeth have shifted significantly and you are unhappy with the way they look, there are a few options that you could consider to correct their position:\n\nOrthodontic treatment: This may involve wearing braces or aligners to gently guide your teeth back into position. This is usually the most effective way to correct misaligned teeth, but it can be time-consuming and may not be the most convenient option for you.\n\nBonding: If your teeth have only shifted slightly, you may be able to correct their position using dental bonding. This involves applying a composite resin material to your teeth and sculpting it into the desired shape. Bonding can be completed in a single office visit, but it may not be as durable as other treatment options.\n\nVeneers: If you want to make more significant changes to the appearance of your front teeth, you may want to consider veneers. Veneers are thin shells that are applied to the front of your teeth and can be used to correct misalignment, as well as other cosmetic issues. Veneers are more expensive than bonding and require more than one office visit to complete.\n\nIt's important to consult with a dentist or orthodontist to determine the best course of treatment for your specific needs.

These include muscle strength and coordination, balance, and overall physical development. Infants also need to learn how to use their muscles to control their movements and maintain their balance.\n\nIf your daughter is 9 months old and is having difficulty supporting her own weight and standing upright, it is possible that she simply needs more time to develop the necessary muscle strength and coordination.

This type of fracture is considered a medical emergency because it carries a higher risk of infection.\n\nThe treatment for a compound fracture typically involves the following steps:\n\nControl bleeding: If the bone has punctured the skin, there may be significant bleeding. The first priority is to control the bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound and elevating the injured limb above heart level, if possible.\n\nAdminister pain medication: The patient will likely be given pain medication to help manage the pain associated with the fracture.\n\nClean the wound: The wound will need to be thoroughly cleaned to reduce the risk of infection. This may involve using a sterile solution or irrigation to clean out any debris or dirt.\n\nSet the bone: Once the wound has been cleaned and the bleeding has been controlled, the bone will need to be set back into place. This may be done using traction, splinting, or surgery.\n\nClose the wound: If the wound is small, it may be closed using sutures (stitches). If the wound is larger or if there is significant tissue damage, the wound may need to be left open and allowed to heal on its own.\n\nRehabilitation: After the bone has been set and the wound has been closed, the patient will likely need to undergo physical therapy to help restore strength and mobility to the injured limb.\n\nIt's important to seek medical treatment as soon as possible for a compound fracture.

These changes are quite specific and characteristic and it is not likely that other medical conditions like indigestion would have produced them. Also, since these changes were seen on several different occasions, this makes an anteroseptal infarct  quite certain.After an infarct the damaged area of the heart muscle undergoes scarring and it may also result in thickening of that area as seen on the Echocardiogram.Some patients, especially diabetics, do not have symptoms like chest pain when they are having their heart attacks, so it is possible to just see the EKG changes of an \"old MI\" old myocarial infarction on an EKG while the patient does not even know that they had a heart attack.Typically an acute heart attack causes severe chest pain, Shortness of breath and makes one very ill and treatment in the hospital is required , where blood tests are done to confirm a diagnosis of so called acute MI.Hope this helps you understand this issue.Wishing you best of health."],"chatgpt_answers":["An anteroseptal infarct on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is caused by a blockage in the blood flow to the front and center of the heart muscle, also known as the septum. This blockage can be caused by a clot in one of the coronary arteries that supplies blood to the heart. If the blockage is not promptly treated, it can lead to damage or death of the heart muscle tissue in the affected area, known as a myocardial infarction or heart attack.\n\nIf an ECG shows evidence of an anteroseptal infarct on several different occasions and an echocardiogram shows a thickened septal area, it is highly likely that the anteroseptal infarct actually occurred. It is not uncommon for people who have had a heart attack to experience recurrent symptoms or ECG changes, as the damage to the heart muscle may not be fully reversible.\n\nIt is important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms that may be related to a heart attack, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or discomfort in the neck, jaw, arms, or back.

Warfarin is a blood thinner which is prescribed if a person has propensity to develop or has developed clots in the legs, in patients with irregular heart rate (AF) and in patients post valve replacement. I would be in a better position to help you had you provided the details.Coronary Angiogram is done to evaluate presence of blockages in the heart. On baisi of the findings of angiogram you may be suggested either medical management, or angioplasty or bypass surgery. Angioplasty can be done if there are short blockages on the arteries. It is a 1-3 HR procedure that can be done in the same sitting and the patient usually gets back on his legs on the next day. Bypass surgery is adviced when there are multiple widespread blockages involving the major arteries of the heart. Bypass surgery requires planning, patient preparation etc. Again it takes about 4 days to patient to be back on his legs and some 20 days to recover totally. But the long term results of bypass are very good. Since he is diabetic he has a tendency to develop heart blockages so be prepared for an angioplasty if suggested. I suppose I have answered your queries satisfactorily. Wishing him good health. Regards"],"chatgpt_answers":["An angiogram is a procedure that uses x-ray imaging to visualize the blood vessels (arteries and veins) inside the body. It is typically done to help diagnose and treat problems with blood flow, such as blockages or narrowing of the vessels. The procedure involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the arm or leg, and injecting a dye that can be seen on x-ray images.\n\nWarfarin is a medication that is used to prevent blood clots from forming. It works by inhibiting the production of certain proteins that are involved in the blood clotting process. Warfarin is often prescribed to people who are at risk of developing blood clots, such as those with a history of heart attack, stroke, or certain types of arrhythmias.\n\nIf your father has been taking warfarin for a long time and has recently stopped taking the medication in preparation for the angiogram, it is possible that his blood may be more prone to clotting than usual. However, this does not necessarily mean that the angiogram will be risky or that there will be any complications. The medical team performing the procedure will take steps to ensure the safety of your father during the procedure, such as monitoring his vital signs and administering medications as needed. It is important for your father to follow any pre-procedure instructions provided by the medical team and to inform them of any medications he is taking, including warfarin."]}

However, the decision to postpone the surgery due to low blood pressure would ultimately be made by the surgeon and other medical professionals involved in the patient's care, based on a thorough assessment of the patient's overall health and readiness for surgery."]}
{"question":"Tooth pain in lower left side of jaw. X-ray shows severe cavity. RCT suggested. Alternative treatment options?Hi, I have pain in some tooth in lower left side of my jaw.

It's important to address dental issues as soon as possible to prevent further complications. Root canal treatment (RCT) is a common procedure used to remove infected or damaged tissue inside a tooth. It's often recommended when the pulp (the soft tissue inside the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels) becomes infected or damaged. RCT can help save a tooth that would otherwise need to be removed.\n\nWhile RCT is a common and generally safe procedure, it's understandable that you may be looking for alternative treatment options. Some potential options to consider before undergoing RCT include:\n\nFilling the cavity: If the cavity is small and not too close to the pulp, your dentist may recommend a filling to repair the damage.\n\nAntibiotics: If the infection is limited to the surface of the tooth, your dentist may prescribe antibiotics to help clear the infection before proceeding with RCT.\n\nExtracting the tooth: If the tooth is severely damaged or infected and cannot be saved with RCT, your dentist may recommend extracting the tooth. This is generally a last resort, as it's important to try to preserve as many natural teeth as possible.\n\nIt's important to discuss all of your treatment options with your dentist and consider their professional recommendations. It's also a good idea to get a second opinion from another dentist if you have concerns about the recommended treatment.\n\nI'm not able to recommend specific doctors in your area, as it's important to choose a healthcare provider that you feel comfortable with and trust. You can ask friends or family members for recommendations, or you can check with your insurance provider for a list of in-network dentists in your area. You can also check online directories or do research on individual dentists to learn more about their qualifications and experience."]}
{"question":"How to get rid the stiff jaws and pain in the temples?Hi!I am suffering from the problem of stiff jaws & pain in temples for the past 3 days. I am unable to sleep due to this problem.

Hope it will help you."],"chatgpt_answers":["I'm sorry to hear that you are experiencing stiffness and pain in your jaws and temples. There are a few possible causes for these symptoms, and it's important to identify the underlying cause in order to determine the appropriate treatment. Here are a few things you can try to help alleviate the stiffness and pain:\n\nApply heat or cold to the affected area. You can use a warm or cold pack, or alternatively, take a warm shower or bath to help relax the muscles and reduce inflammation.\n\nTry massaging the affected area. Gently massaging the temples or jaw muscles can help to relax them and alleviate tension.\n\nPractice good posture. Poor posture can lead to tension in the neck and jaw muscles, so try to sit or stand up straight to help reduce tension in these areas.\n\nAvoid stressful situations or activities. Stress can contribute to muscle tension, so try to find ways to relax and manage your stress levels.\n\nTake over-the-counter pain medication as needed. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen can help to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain.\n\nIt's important to note that Mobizox (meloxicam) is a prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to relieve pain and inflammation. While it can be effective in reducing pain, it also has the potential for serious side effects, including an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. If your dentist has prescribed Mobizox for you, it's important to follow their instructions and discuss any concerns you have with them. If you are experiencing severe or persistent stiffness and pain in your jaws and temples, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment."]}

The child is then trained to wake up and go to the bathroom when the alarm goes off.\n\nMedication: Desmopressin is a medication that can be used to reduce the amount of urine produced at night. It is typically taken before bedtime and can be effective in reducing bedwetting.\n\nBladder training: This involves teaching the child to increase the amount of time between urination and gradually increase the amount of fluid they drink. This can help strengthen the bladder muscles and improve bladder control.\n\nLimiting fluids before bedtime: Limiting the amount of fluids the child consumes before bedtime can help reduce the likelihood of bedwetting.\n\nDiet changes: Some children may have food allergies or sensitivities that can contribute to bedwetting. It may be helpful to eliminate certain foods from the child's diet to see if this makes a difference.\n\nYou can have food allergy tests carried out at a medical clinic or laboratory.

The redness also goes away then comes back and my feet and palms itch. The circles and lines look really scary, like crop circles or something","human_answers":["Hi. Welcome to HCMfrom what you described you seem to be having allergic reactions causing wheals or hives. Is this the first episode or do you have a previous history of allergies in the past. Try and recall any possible cause of the rash. Any history of outdoor activity, exposure to plants, dust, animals, chemicals, any medication , any particular food. Anything you have been allergic to in the past?Once you can narrow down the possible factor, you will have to avoid it or you will keep having similar reactions. Seeing circles and lines, either white or reddish wherever you apply pressure, or scratch, is called dermographism and is a sign of sensitivity and high allergy levels in blood. So do consult a doctor regarding tests for the blood levels of eosinophils, serum IgE etc, which can show allergy. Skin tests can also be done to check specific reactions.Very rarely this reaction can happen even in normal skin.Apply a menthol\/calamine lotion for the itching, 2-3 times a day. Start an antihistamine daily for 5-7 days after consulting the dermatologist. They may advise a longer course after seeing your blood work. This can help bring the allergy levels in control.If it is severe or persistent, you may be advised a cortisone shot in the ER.Use a mild soap for washing, avoid harsh chemicals. In case you have severe swelling, puffiness of face, lips, difficulty breathing, etc go to the ER immediately.Hope this helps guide you.

The fertilized egg would need to travel through the fallopian tube and into the uterus, where it could implant in the uterine lining and begin to grow. This process, known as fertilization, typically occurs within a day or two after ovulation, which is when an egg is released from the ovary.\n\nIf you have not yet ovulated, it is possible that the Fertigyn injections you took may cause ovulation to occur. Ovulation typically occurs about 14 days after the start of the menstrual cycle, but this can vary from person to person. It is difficult to predict exactly when ovulation will occur, but it is generally thought to be more likely to occur within a day or two after the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, which is the hormone responsible for triggering ovulation.\n\nIt is generally recommended to have intercourse around the time of ovulation if you are trying to become pregnant. However, it is important to note that it is possible to become pregnant at any time during the menstrual cycle, as sperm can live inside the female reproductive tract for several days. If you are trying to become pregnant, it is generally recommended to have regular, unprotected intercourse throughout the menstrual cycle to increase your chances of conceiving.\n\nIf you are concerned about your fertility or are having difficulty becoming pregnant, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider. They can help you understand your fertility and suggest appropriate treatment options if necessary."]}

If the lymphadenitis is due to some kind of infection being spread by any of the draining areas like the lower limb, or genitalia, it might get smaller and relieved by anti inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, but there would be no effect on hernia by these.

{"question":"Q. Can we opt growth hormone to increase the height?Hello doctor,My son is 5'6 in height. He is 17 years old and wants to be taller. We want to try growth hormone. Is this possible? Kindly suggest the treatment.","human_answers":["Hello. I read your query, and from what information you have given me, it appears that your son has short constitutional stature and not growth hormone deficiency. Well, but it depends on many factors such as the mid-parental height, ethnicity, nutritional status, etc. Since he is below the third percentile for age for boys for height, I would suggest a proper work-up to rule out hormonal deficiencies such as, 1. Thyroid function test. 2. IGF-1 (insluin-growth fractor) and IGFBP-3 (insulin-like growth fractor binding protein). 3. LH (leutinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) routine tests like CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation arte). 4. Liver function test. 5. Renal function test.6. Urinalysis, and X-ray of left hand and wrist. If the hormone analysis comes out abnormal or in other words, there is a deficiency of any of the above hormones, and then I would suggest MRI pituitary gland. Because short constitutional stature is not a disorder but a variation in normal growth, therefore, medical treatment is not usually necessary.So I would not suggest any hormonal treatment as it will not benefit him at this age as his bones have matured by now. Although some studies do suggest the use of testosterone injections or patches to achieve growth and sexual maturation if necessary. Growth hormone is not recommended if any of the above tests turn out to be normal as it is associated with a lot of adverse effects. I hope my advice is of some benefit to you."],"chatgpt_answers":["Growth hormone (GH) is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that plays a role in growth and development. While GH can help to stimulate growth in children and adolescents, it is generally not effective for increasing adult height.\n\nHuman growth hormone is usually prescribed for children and adolescents who are growth hormone deficient, or who have certain other medical conditions that affect growth. It is not usually prescribed for the purpose of increasing adult height.\n\nIf your son is interested in increasing his height, it is important to first determine the cause of his current height. There are several factors that can affect growth and development, including genetics, nutrition, and medical conditions. If your son's height is within the normal range for his age and there are no underlying medical conditions that may be affecting his growth, it is unlikely that growth hormone treatment will be effective in increasing his height.\n\nIt is important to speak with a healthcare provider about your son's concerns about his height and any treatment options that may be appropriate.

The symptoms you described indicate that it is due to either estrogen deficiency or a condition called Asherman's syndrome (adhesion or fibrosis of the endometrium after dilation and curettage). Though this is uncommon after an abortion by suction method, it is usually seen when abortions are done with metal instruments and done very vigorously. This results in adhesions in the inner uterine lining which result in less blood flow during the period. The other possible reason is decreased estrogen production in your body. This could be either due to stress or mental anxiety. Try a hysteroscopy to diagnose Asherman's syndrome. It will not be diagnosed with an ultrasound.

{"question":"Is heart palpitation interconnected to blood in stool?I have been suffering from heart palpitations for more than 3 years, but now they have gotten worse i-e 120-140 bpm with a simplest activity (standing,walking etc). Recently, i noticed blood in my stool.My question is, are these symptoms interconnected?","human_answers":["Dear Patient,      Thank you very much for your question. According to American heart association, normal healthy heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute when you are relaxed and not engaged in a physical activity. If your heart rate is 100 bpm or above while you are resting and relaxed it is called as tachycardia. However, If you engage in any physical activity your heart rate can race up. That is normal.  Subtracting your age from 220 you can find out your maximum heart rate. For instance, If you are 50 years old, your maximum heart rate is 220-50= 170 bpm. Anyway in your condition, I would recommend that you consult your family doctor for a physical examination and proper consultation. I am sure your family doctor will direct you to a  normal ECG test and stress ECG or exercise ECG test to rule out some pathologies appearing during physical activities. Also he or she may direct you to a holter monitor test if necessary to rule out some arrhythmias.  Conditions like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter can cause very high pulse rate like yours and sometimes for that cause is hyperthyroidism. Therefore, you might need to check your thyroid function too.               Concerning your blood in stool, I think it might be as a result of gastrointestinal pathology and I hardly believe it is  related to your high pulse rate.Also I want to ask you the color of blood you noticed on your stool. Red color fresh blood on stool can be due to hemorrhoids or due to hard stool passage  while black stool can be as a result of hemorrhage due to ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis etc.  In order to diagnose these conditions, again you have to do a stool test and explain all other symptoms you have. You may need to undergo an endoscopy if your physician wants to rule out above mentioned diseases.  I think your blood in stool may be related to a gastrointestinal pathology.Therefore, I will highly recommend that you consult your family doctor for proper consultation,diagnosis and treatment.  I hope that I've answered your question. If you have any further questions,please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe.

What is the best remedy for renal colic and how to take preventive measures?","human_answers":["Hi there. Thank you for posting your question with Healthcaremagic. I will do my best to help you. The prevention of kidney stone is a complex subject and there is loads of good information on this on the Internet. I would recommend the Mayo Clinic's web site as an excellent place to start. Also, you need to discuss this with you own doctor or urologist. First of all it depends on what type of stone is developing in your kidney or bladder. This has to be determined. If you can, develop the habit of urinating through a sieve just in case you can catch a small stone for your doctor to send for analysis. Most stones are calcium based. Dietary restrictions in calcium is however no longer recommended. This is because it does not seem to work and, in any case, calcium is an important mineral for proper bodily functioning. Some stones are composed of uric acid in which case allopurinol, to lower uric acid levels, may be prescribed. All recurrence rate of all stones can be reduced by increasing daily fluid intake. The cheapest way to achieve this is by drinking lots of water. The aim should be to increase fluid intake to the point where you are passing at least four pints of urine every day.

You should also aim to eat a healthy, balanced diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and avoid foods that are high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.\n\nIf you have a sedentary lifestyle, it is important to get regular physical activity to help prevent kidney stones.

Corns are a common problem for diabetics, as diabetes can cause changes in the skin and circulation that make the feet more prone to developing these types of lesions.

Avoid shoes with pointed or narrow toes or high heels, as these can put extra pressure on your toes.\n\nUse padding or cushioning: To help reduce pressure on areas of your feet prone to developing corns, you can try using pads or cushions made specifically for this purpose.

{"question":"How to rid of hypertension?Nearly four months ago I developed a bad dose of flu. Since then I have not been able to smell or taste anything.

There is no need to use an emergency contraceptive pill around the menstrual period because this is the safe period. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period. So, in the manner you have described, you cannot get pregnant and hence, there is no need to worry. Also, restrict the use of emergency contraceptive pills to once or twice a year since they have a high hormone content and hence disturb the hormone milieu of the body badly. Hope this helps."],"chatgpt_answers":["Emergency contraception, sometimes called the \"morning-after pill,\" is a type of birth control that can be taken after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure to prevent pregnancy. It is not intended to be used as a regular method of birth control and should not be taken more than once in a menstrual cycle. If you have had unprotected sex on multiple occasions and are concerned about the possibility of pregnancy, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider as soon as possible. They can help you determine the best course of action for your situation.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are other, more reliable methods of birth control that can be used to prevent pregnancy. These include:\n\nOral contraceptives (the \"pill\"): These are pills that contain hormones that prevent pregnancy. They are taken daily and are available in different forms, including combination pills (which contain both estrogen and progestin) and progestin-only pills. Oral contraceptives are effective at preventing pregnancy when taken correctly, but they are not foolproof and can fail if you miss a dose or vomit after taking them.\n\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs): These are small, T-shaped devices that are inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. There are two types of IUDs: copper and hormonal. Copper IUDs work by releasing small amounts of copper into the uterus to kill or damage sperm, while hormonal IUDs release a low dose of progestin to thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus. IUDs are highly effective at preventing pregnancy and can be left in place for several years.\n\nBarrier methods: These are physical barriers that prevent sperm from reaching the egg. Examples include male condoms, female condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps. Barrier methods are effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly, but they do not provide as much protection as other methods.\n\nIt's important to choose a birth control method that is right for you and to use it consistently and correctly to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. If you have any questions or concerns about your options, it is a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider or a reproductive health professional. They can provide you with information and guidance on the different methods of birth control and help you choose the one that is best suited to your needs."]}

They are made up of muscle and connective tissue and can vary in size and number. Fibroids are more common in women who are overweight or obese, and they are also more common in women who are over the age of 35.\n\nThe cause of fibroids is not fully understood, but it is thought that hormonal imbalances, particularly an excess of estrogen, may play a role. Other possible risk factors for developing fibroids include a family history of fibroids, having never given birth, and certain ethnicities (such as African-American).\n\nAs for the lump outside your uterus, it is not possible for me to determine the cause without more information.

It can cause muscle weakness and paralysis, and it can be life-threatening if it affects the muscles that control breathing.\n\nTo confirm a diagnosis of GBS, a healthcare provider will typically perform a physical examination, review the patient's medical history, and order laboratory tests and imaging studies. The healthcare provider may also perform a nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test, which measures the speed at which electrical impulses travel through a nerve. In GBS, NCV is often slowed.\n\nOther tests that may be used to confirm a diagnosis of GBS include:\n\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap): This test involves removing a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lower back. An abnormal CSF protein level may suggest GBS.\n\nElectromyography (EMG): This test measures the electrical activity of muscles. It can help confirm nerve damage and determine the extent of muscle weakness.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI can help identify any abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord that may be causing the symptoms.\n\nIt's important to note that the diagnosis of GBS can be challenging, as the symptoms can vary widely from person to person. A healthcare provider will consider all of the available information to make a diagnosis."]}

If the clot breaks or moving, then will D-dimer work? What else could cause pulmonary embolism like symptoms?\nAspirin is an antiplatelet drug that is commonly used to prevent blood clots. It is not known to affect the results of a D-dimer test.\n\nA D-dimer test is used to help diagnose a pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a blood clot. The D-dimer test measures the levels of a protein fragment (D-dimer) that is produced when a blood clot breaks down. Elevated levels of D-dimer can be a sign of a blood clot, but a negative D-dimer test does not necessarily rule out the possibility of a PE.\n\nThere are other conditions that can cause symptoms similar to those of a PE, such as heart failure, pneumonia, and asthma. It is important to discuss your symptoms with a healthcare provider to determine the cause and appropriate treatment. They may recommend further testing or evaluation, such as a CT scan or an echocardiogram, to help diagnose the cause of your symptoms."]}

Applying Neosporin can help to prevent infection and promote healing. It's also a good idea for your fiance to avoid sexual activity until the area has fully healed. This will give the frenulum time to properly heal and reduce the risk of further injury or complications.\n\nOnce the frenulum has fully healed, it's likely that your fiance's sexual function will return to normal. However, it's important to note that every person is different and healing times can vary. If your fiance experiences any persistent pain or difficulty with sexual activity after the frenulum has healed, it's important for him to speak with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment.\n\nIt's also worth noting that tearing the frenulum should not have any effect on your fiance's reproductive status.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

Hope my answer helps you. Regards"],"chatgpt_answers":["If you are trying to get pregnant and have irregular periods, it may be helpful to track your menstrual cycle and try to identify any patterns or predict when you are most likely to ovulate. Ovulation is the process of the release of an egg from the ovary, and it is necessary for pregnancy to occur.\n\nThere are several ways you can track your menstrual cycle and try to predict when you are ovulating:\n\nKeep a menstrual calendar: This involves tracking the length of your menstrual cycle and the dates of your periods. The length of a menstrual cycle is typically 28 days, but it can range from 21 to 35 days. Ovulation typically occurs around day 14 of a 28-day cycle, but this can vary based on the length of your cycle.\n\nUse ovulation predictor kits: These kits are available at pharmacies and can help you predict when you are ovulating by detecting the presence of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine. LH surges just before ovulation and can be detected with an ovulation predictor kit.\n\nTrack your basal body temperature: Your basal body temperature is your body's temperature at rest. It tends to rise slightly after ovulation. By taking your temperature every morning before you get out of bed and tracking it over time, you may be able to identify patterns and predict when you are most likely to ovulate.\n\nIt is also important to talk to your doctor about any concerns you have about your menstrual cycle and fertility. Your doctor may be able to suggest treatments or medications that can help regulate your menstrual cycle and increase your chances of getting pregnant. For example, the medication Fertyl (clomiphene) is often used to treat infertility in women with irregular periods. However, it is important to use this or any other medication only as directed by a healthcare provider."]}

However, it is important to note that herpes and strep throat are two different infections caused by different viruses or bacteria.\n\nHerpes is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and can cause cold sores or genital sores. It is possible for a child to be infected with herpes at birth if the mother has genital herpes, but this is relatively rare. It is more common for children to become infected with herpes through close contact with someone who has an active herpes infection, such as through kissing or sharing utensils or cups.\n\nStrep throat is caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes and is a common infection that affects the throat and tonsils. It is most common in children between the ages of 5 and 15, but it can occur at any age. Strep throat is typically spread through close contact with an infected person, such as through coughing, sneezing, or sharing utensils or cups.\n\nThe symptoms you have described, including red spots on the roof of the mouth and tongue and a creamy white residue, could potentially be caused by either herpes or strep throat. It is important to have your son examined by a healthcare provider to determine the cause of these symptoms and to receive appropriate treatment. The provider may need to perform a physical examination and possibly order some tests, such as a throat culture or a herpes test, to diagnose the cause of your son's symptoms."]}

{"question":"Can I conceive while taking anti tubercular medicines?Dear doctor, I am 33 yrs old female having anti tubercular medicines for asymptomatic acites with mantoux test positive for 4 months, i am now taking Rcinex 600. i have to take it 2 more months according to my physician. Now i want to know if i can concieve during taking this medicine , is there any harm being pregnant?","human_answers":["Hallow Dear,Tuberculosis affects the fertility by:1. Reducing general health. Mother nature has arranged our body functioning in such a way that whenever there is any risk to life, the reproductory function is jeopardized first. However, Tuberculosis is such commonly wide spread disease in India and still the population is increasing. By and large, Pulmonary tuberculosis in early stage does not affect fertility. 2. By affecting the Reproductory Organs: When there is Genital tuberculosis, the tubes and uterine lining (endometrium) get affected. Affected endometrium is not conducive for implantation of the fertilized ovum and hence pregnancy is not possible. When the tubes get affected, there is tubal block. Along with the tubal block, tubal musculature also gets affected causing dysfunction in the tubal motility. Therefore, even after the surgical correction of the tubal block, if the tubal peristaltic movements are affected, conception is not possible. This is called as Functional Tubal Block; i.e. physically patent still functionally blocked tubes. You are suffering from Tubercular ascites. There is a good chance that due to ascetic fluid and peritoneal tubercular infection, the tubes and uterus also may be affected. Even, affection of the ovaries will affect the egg release function of the ovaries.Once your anti-tubercular treatment is over and you are declared completely cured of the tuberculosis, you should undergo some investigations like Hysterosalpingography (X-ray of uterus and tubes with radio-opaque dye in it) and\/or Laparoscopy to assess the status of endometrium and tubes. Ultrasonography also will be of use for the purpose. These investigations only will inform us whether your reproductory organs are in a state to offer you any successful pregnancy. Madam, your first aim should be to get cured from Tuberculosis. Once you are cured, get investigated for fertility potential. Even if you are unable to conceive, you can adopt a child - this will give you a desired child, the child will get parents and still the population will not be increased. I hope this helps you with relevant information.

In people with type 2 diabetes, elevated CPK levels may be due to muscle damage resulting from poorly controlled blood sugar levels or complications such as neuropathy (nerve damage) or nephropathy (kidney damage).

These ingredients can help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria.

The probability of getting pregnant naturally decreases as a woman gets older, so if you are over 35 years old, it may take longer to conceive. It is also important to consider your lifestyle and habits, as certain behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and drug use can affect fertility.\n\nIf you and your husband have been trying to conceive for at least one year without success, it may be helpful to consult with a healthcare provider or fertility specialist to discuss potential causes and treatment options. They can help you identify any potential issues and recommend a plan for moving forward."]}

Giving her Gatorade and milk can help to replenish fluids and electrolytes, but it's also important to try to get her to eat a well-balanced diet to provide the nutrients she needs for her body to recover.\n\nIf your grandchild's appetite does not improve after a few days or if she continues to have diarrhea, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance. The healthcare professional will be able to assess your grandchild's overall health and determine if there are any underlying issues that need to be addressed.\n\nIn the meantime, there are a few things you can try to help increase your grandchild's appetite:\n\nOffer small, frequent meals and snacks rather than three large meals. Children's appetites can vary from day to day, and they may be more likely to eat if they are offered smaller amounts of food more frequently.\n\nOffer a variety of healthy, appealing foods. Children are more likely to eat if they are offered a variety of foods that they find appealing.\n\nEncourage your grandchild to eat at regular mealtimes and create a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere at meal times.\n\nAvoid pressuring your grandchild to eat or forcing her to eat certain foods. This can make meal times stressful and may actually decrease her appetite.\n\nIt's generally not necessary to take your grandchild off milk unless she has a specific allergy or intolerance. Milk is an important source of nutrients, including protein, calcium, and vitamin D, and it can be helpful in promoting healing and recovery after an illness. If you have concerns about your grandchild's diet or nutrition, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for guidance."]}

So these healed areas appear as scar lesion on chest x ray. They will be seen as it is for lifetime. So presence of this fibrotic lesion is not suggestive of tuberculosis. Your sputum report is also negative. So you are mostly having healed lesion and not having active tb lesion. But if you really want to rule out active tuberculosis then get done CT thorax and bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis.

Active PTB means that the bacteria are actively growing and multiplying in your body, and you may experience symptoms such as coughing, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. If you have had a positive sputum test and were diagnosed with PTB, it is likely that you received treatment to kill the bacteria and prevent the disease from becoming active.\n\nIf your chest X-ray shows minimal PTB, it may mean that the bacteria are still present in your body but are not causing active disease.

The results of a follicular study can provide useful information about the timing of ovulation and the potential for pregnancy.

It appears that you have one functioning ovary, as there is no mention of a left ovary. On days 9, 11, 13, and 15 of your cycle, the size of the follicles in your right ovary increased, with the largest follicle measuring 9.8mm on day 15. This suggests that ovulation may have occurred around this time or shortly thereafter.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the size of the follicles and the timing of ovulation can vary from cycle to cycle, and what is considered \"normal\" can vary from person to person. In general, a follicle should reach a mature size of around 18-30mm before ovulation occurs.\n\nTo increase your chances of getting pregnant, it is important to have regular, unprotected sex around the time of ovulation.

They can appear anywhere on the body, but are commonly found on the face, particularly the chin and around the lips.\n\nThere are several steps you can take to help clear or lessen the appearance of whiteheads:\n\nKeep your skin clean: Wash your face twice a day with a mild, oil-free cleanser to remove excess oil and dirt. Avoid scrubbing your skin, as this can irritate it and make the problem worse.\n\nUse salicylic acid: This is a type of beta hydroxy acid that helps to exfoliate the skin and unclog pores.

Look for products that are labeled \"non-comedogenic\" or \"oil-free.\"\n\nAvoid touching your face: Hands can transfer bacteria and oil to the skin, so it's important to avoid touching your face as much as possible.\n\nAvoid picking or squeezing whiteheads: This can cause inflammation and may lead to scarring. If you do need to extract a whitehead, make sure to do it gently and with clean hands and tools.\n\nUse a gentle exfoliant: Gently exfoliating your skin can help to remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. Look for products that contain alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs).\n\nUse a spot treatment: If you have a single whitehead that you need to treat, you can use a spot treatment that contains benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.

It's important to get any injury checked out by a medical professional, especially if you're experiencing pain or swelling. Hard lumps can sometimes be a sign of a more serious injury or condition, such as a fracture or a cyst.\n\nIf you haven't already done so, it's a good idea to make an appointment with a doctor or a physiotherapist to have your injury evaluated. They will be able to assess the lump and determine the cause. Depending on the cause, they may recommend treatment options, such as ice, rest, elevation, physical therapy, or medications.\n\nIt's also important to take care of your ankle while you're on your long-distance flight. Try to avoid standing for long periods of time, and wear comfortable shoes that provide support for your feet. If you need to elevate your foot, you can use a footrest or a small pillow. Avoiding prolonged periods of inactivity can also help reduce swelling.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask."]}

{"question":"Is rise in pressure from 116\/66 to 140\/80 normal?I have PAD and am on 40mg of Lisinopril a day. I have been taking 1\/2 of that some days as my blood pressure has been dropping giving me a quick feeling of faintness and I am tired a lot of the time. My pressure today was 116\/66 then within an hour was up to 140\/80 then later dropped again. Is this normal?","human_answers":["Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that these blood pressure fluctuations are quite normal during the day. They are related to physical or emotional activity. Isolated blood pressure are not conclusive for high blood pressure. I would recommend measuring your blood pressure frequently during the day (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and write those values in a notebook. You should do this for a week and then show these values to your doctor in order to make the proper changes to your actual therapy. Some blood lab tests may be needed to exclude other possible causes of blood pressure fluctuations: - complete blood count- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid dysfunction- inflammation tests (PCR, sedimentation rate). Hope you will find this answer helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"],"chatgpt_answers":["It's not uncommon for blood pressure to fluctuate throughout the day, and a single reading may not necessarily reflect your overall blood pressure. However, a significant increase in blood pressure such as the one you described could be a cause for concern, especially if you have peripheral artery disease (PAD) and are taking lisinopril to manage your blood pressure. It's important to discuss this change in your blood pressure with your healthcare provider, as they may need to adjust your medication or recommend lifestyle changes to help manage your blood pressure. They may also want to monitor your blood pressure more closely to see if there are any patterns or underlying issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, it's important to continue taking your medication as prescribed and to follow any other recommendations your healthcare provider may have for managing your blood pressure."]}
